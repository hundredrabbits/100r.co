Rekka was working in an animation studio, and Devine, in a company that makes language learning tools. On weekends and evenings, we worked on our first two games: <a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/hiversaires' target='_blank' class='external'>Hiversaires</a> and <a href='http://oquonie.100r.co' target='_blank' class='external'>Oquonie</a> (the latter was completed in Thailand).</p><p>After we returned to Canada in 2014, we decided that we wanted to keep moving, and so we looked at our options. Moving to a new country meant selling all we had, we'd done this countless times already, but we thought it wasteful. We then heard of people living on sailboats. We watched videos by <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF9TNM9R-iw'>David Wellsford</a>, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkaH_UUH0Ek'>Teresa Carey</a> and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkYfFeySHGN4DPrOc9So7PA'>Nike Steiger</a>, and became obssessed with the idea. Lack of experience aside, we thought that traveling was a good catalyst for learning new languages, for developing an interest in foreign cultures and ultimately for building empathy, curiosity, and creativity, traits that we will need to foster, as a species, if we want to survive the years to come.</p><p>In January 2016, we left the cold of Montreal and moved west to British Columbia. There, we purchased <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Pino/blob/master/README.md' target='_blank'>Pino</a> — keep in mind, we were a pair of city kids with limited outdoor experience, neither of us had ever stepped onto a sailboat before. That, did not deter us. We learned on the go, reading books and asking questions to other sailors on the docks.</p><p>Our curiosity then led us to make our first trip out to sea, which escalated into a circumnagivation of the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Our experiences at sea has changed how we work, and how we think.
