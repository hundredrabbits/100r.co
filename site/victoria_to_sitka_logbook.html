<h1>victoria to sitka logbook</h1>
<h2 id='transcript'>transcript</h2>
<p>On the passage from <b><a href='victoria.html' class='local'>Victoria</a></b> to <b><a href='sitka.html' class='local'>Sitka</a></b> we traveled 1,800 NM, the journey lasting from May 1st to August 11th 2024. Rek kept a logbook of our travels, to help us remember the conditions we encountered, our thoughts at the time, etc. Sailing near shore, we think, is more difficult than sailing offshore, there are more obstacles to deal with, like traffic, reefs, currents, and land effects on wind.</p>
<p>Our aim was to get near 58°N, the highest we sailed on this trip was 57°N. We wanted to explore Southeast Alaska and the north coast of British Columbia, to experience anchoring in deeper waters, and to see if we could enjoy sailing in colder, rainier weather.</p>

    <td><b><a href='victoria.html' class='local'>Victoria</a> to Sidney</b><hr><img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_photo_01.jpg'alt="view from the deck of a sailboat of a lighthouse with snowcapped mountains in the background" loading='lazy'></a>I awoke to an awful sound, an alarm ringing at 0540. Devine had been waking up at 0600 every second day all year to go to the gym, and so was used to this, but I could not find my feet. The morning was rude, I couldn't persuade my body to leave the bed to face it — it had taken us so long to build up this much warmth! I knew that current waits for no one, and so with eyes still closed, my legs crawled out of the blankets, my body inevitably followed, ragdolling out of bed and into the cold.<br>We got dressed, to preserve what little warmth we had left, then made sure that everything aboard was secured for our sail to Sidney. We're always forgetful when we haven't sailed in a while. In the winter, the boat is still, so still that it becomes part of the land. <a href='pino.html' class='local'>Pino</a> sways at the dock in heavy winds, but nothing threatens to fall over, the motion is never violent. Now, each item must go back to its assigned spot, lashed down.<br>There is light outside at this hour, it helps, but waking before the birds is not right. As soon as we moved outside, Peter, our dock neighbor and good friend, was there to greet us. Peter, like myself, doesn't share Devine's early hour waking habit, but he knew we were leaving, and made an effort to be there to say goodbye. Even at this early morning hour, Peter looked as dapper as ever, Peter, who goes to the gym in corduroy pants and button down shirts. We hug, he helps us push off.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
    <td>Pino glided away from the dock on calm waters, propelled by Calcifer II. Our departure awoke another neighbor, Gunther, he was outside, and he too waved us off, "where are you going again?" he asked. "Alaska!" we whisper-shouted back as we drifted past — it was early, we didn't want to make more noise than necessary. The little ephemeral floating community we'd found was precious, like birds returning to land to nest every year, we all gather in the fall, and come spring, everyone flies away. Some birds return to the nest, others don't, drawn by the allure of distant lands.<br> A light breeze greeted us at the mouth of the outer Victoria Harbour, we hoisted Pino's wings inside the calm of the breakwater. When out in the Juan de Fuca Strait, the body of water that we must cross to get to Sidney, the wind was not strong enough to push us by itself. Calcifer II continued to provide help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>  
    <td>Last winter, we built our own <a href='gimballed_stove.html' class='local'>gimballed stove</a>, we tried it for the first time underway. I toasted bread in our heavy cast iron pan, then coated one side of the crunched-up exterior with peanut butter. While we ate our breakfast, I boiled water to thin the moka pot coffee — doing this fools us into thinking there is more coffee to drink. I passed the grinder to Devine outside who was steering and holding the tiller with one leg. We had modified our tiller head for this trip, it was now low enough that we could steer like this, freeing our hands for other tasks. We bought this wooden tiller at a scrapyard in Sonoma(California) in 2016, when sailing down the west coast of the United States. The head, which binds the tiller to the rudder stock, forced it at an angle that was abnormally high for steering, but the tiller itself was perfect. We rectified the design this year, but only because a crack had formed in the head which forced us to put together a makeshift replacement, consisting of an aluminum pipe, several heavy bolts and bungees. When the water in the kettle was hot, I switched it for the moka pot and completed our breakfast routine. The boat wasn't heeling enough for this to be a good first test for our stove, but the unit performed well.</td>

<tr>
    <td>Victoria is on the south end of a peninsula to the southeast of Vancouver Island, Sidney is on the northeastern end of this same peninsula, 25 NM away. When we turned around the south end of the peninsula, the wind left us, as it tends to do in this area. The wind only ever bends around the corner when Juan de Fuca is in a bad mood. The calm lured out several small fishing boats. We laughed, seeing the number of gulls at their heels. Each boat had its own little gull fan club. Some gulls were resting on the cabin tops, the rest were in the water, paddling around, waiting for scraps or for space to free up on the boat. We wondered if the people on those boats liked the gulls. Were they friends? Did they give them names? Or were they a terrible nuisance?</td>

    <td>The wind returned south of James Island, we rode it into Sidney, arriving at 1100.</td>

    <td><b>Sidney to Montague</b><hr><img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_photo_02.jpg' alt="view from the deck of a sailboat, at sail, with a ferry crossing the bow of the vessel" loading='lazy'></a>The alarm rang at 0600, we snoozed until 0640, then left at 0800 to catch the current north to our next anchorage. Bing, bang, boom. After pushing off the dock, we pulled onto another to fill 4x20 L bins with diesel — our main fuel tank only holds 62 L, keeping annexes aboard is necessary for long coastal trips. We hoped the wind would be a frequent companion on our trek north.</td>
</tr>
<tr>  
    <td>The wind was blowing out of the northeast, but we only felt it once past Portland Island. It was coming out of where we needed to go, but as strange as it sounds to those unacquainted with the physics of sailing, a sailboat can work with this. We tightened the sheets and sailed into the wind, tacking as required. Devine read through a thick book documenting Southeast Alaska anchorages, while I, at the tiller, counted cormorants in the water. We saw a group of 30 near Portland Island, with a few gulls amongst them. The gulls were outnumbered, out of place, surrounded by cormorant heads — both were easy to distinguish from afar, because cormorants sink, while gulls float.<img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_02.jpg' alt="a gull afloat on the water surrounded by cormorants, only their heads showing" loading='lazy'>We played dodge-the-ferries, while tacking northward, until the breeze became too weak to sail with. Calcifer II carried us the rest of the way to Montague Harbour. We arrived at 1300. Tacking had added 3 extra nautical miles to our trip. Sailing into the wind is not the quickest way forward, we can't be in a hurry, but timing matters when sailing in waters governed by strong currents. The current reverses many times per day, when it turns against us, progress is slow, and depending on the strength of the current it can stop our vessel outright. If the wind isn't with us, with a current running, progress is a beautiful dream. Our motor can carry us through <i>some</i> current, but it feels like throwing money into the ocean. In these waters, seeing sailboats motor into the wind, constrained by a short tidal exchange, is common.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>We arrived in Montague Harbour, a large anchorage on Galiano Island that can host hundreds of boats, dropping our anchor in 11 m(35 ft). The bay hosts several local boats on moorings, but was otherwise empty. Despite there being large areas free of anchored boats, a large motor boat came into the anchorage, 20 minutes after we had arrived, and dropped their anchor very near ours. Pino is a shiny lure, drawing the attention of bigger fish.<img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_01.jpg' alt="a large motor vessel, drawn as a big cute blog of a creature, is throwing its anchor down close to pino, grinning all the while. Pino is not pleased." loading='lazy'>Inside the cabin, we picked up a few disobedient items that had rolled out of their berths. Some items had found the floor, "this isn't your room," I said, remembering the classic line said by Tom Hanks to a dog in Turner and Hooch — sometimes I fear that too many of my words are borrowed from films.<br>We prepared basmati rice with sauteed sweet potatoes, tofu, and greens, seasoned with soy sauce and mirin, with a side of miso soup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>That night, we continued reading The Martian by Andy Weir. In the book, Mark Whatney must be self-sufficient, he must ration his food to survive. With our upcoming trip, we don't have to ration, our time away from others won't span 4 years, but we do need to be cautious with both food and water. At sea, Pino must be an island.</td>

    <td><b>Montague</b><hr><br>The wind was too light to sail, so we waited in Montague for an extra day. Avi sent us a message, asking if we'd like to go see the Recycling Center's new plastic crusher and press. We rowed Teapot to shore and met Avi at the dinghy dock, he gave us a ride to the Recycling Center.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The new machines transformed plastic waste into new materials, which locals could use to produce art, for construction, or to make replacement parts at home. Same type plastics were gathered — polypropylene, polystyrene, etc. The shredder reduced the plastic into smaller pieces, and a separate machine, a heated hydraulic press, softened and merged the bits into a solid sheet. The size of the sheet depended on the amount of shredded plastic, and the sheet thickness(adjustable with the press). Mixing different colored plastics resulted in a gorgeous mandala daubed with bright and glaring patterns. Ading a single shredded bottle of yellow mustard created amazing contrast. The sheet of plastic ressembled a painting, born of plastic waste.<br>Previously, Galiano Island was exporting all of its plastic waste to the Vancouver mainland, a lot of it now stays on the island, given a second, and hopefully lasting purpose.<br>The recycling center was across from a building that accepts second hand goods, all from residents of Galiano. The center separates all recyclables so they are better processed — just like in Japan. The rest of British Columbia doesn't discern between different kinds of plastics, it also doesn't recycle glass... which is... insane.</td>

    <td><b>Montague to Secretary Islands</b><img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_photo_04.jpg' alt="a photo of a small opening between two islands, with somekind of industrial building way in the background, emitting smoke"  loading='lazy'></a>0830 departure from <a href='galiano.html' class='local'>Galiano</a> Island, with the goal of stopping either at a bight between the Secretary Islands, or at Clam Bay, a short 10 NM sail away. We needed an anchorage that offered protection from both the SE and NW — a difficult find in these waters, given the fact that most bays have either a SE or NW orientation. Montague fits that description, but it was too far south, we wanted to be near Porlier Pass to exit at slack current come morning. The Gulf Islands are surrounded by natural barriers, rapids that prudent sailors ought to take at slack tide, during the calm between the reversal of the current. All of the rapids open onto Georgia Strait, a large body of water that separates Vancouver Island from the mainland coast.<br>The Secretary Islands anchorage was on the way to Clam Bay, we had never been there, but we would go by to check it out, to see if it was suitable for an overnight stay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>We had 5-10 kn on our bow the entire way, but it lessened as we neared our destination. The small bight between the Secretary Islands was open to the north, and we suspected that northwest winds could creep in through Porlier Pass to disturb it, but we decided to chance it.<br>We set our anchor in 6 m (20 ft) of water, in mud. The stronger gusts were curling around the corner, entering the anchorage. The winds later rose to 15-20 kn, but would lessen before dying entirely. It was supposed to turn to the southeast overnight, and to build up come Sunday morning into a strong enough breeze to carry us across the strait. It was likely that we would have endured these same wind conditions in Clam Bay. Clam Bay, a bay tucked between two islands, is full of debris, old crab pots, disused aquaculture gear, it is not our favorite spot. The unnamed bight in the Secretary Islands was a welcome change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>At 1400, the forecast was upgraded to a strong wind warning, with 20-30 kn blowing in the strait — not a fun surprise. The anchorage became more rolly, with the boat yawing with the coming waves. We both felt sea sick. Like before, only the strong gusts penetrated our little bight, but the waves were sneaking around the corner, invading our space. Devine took a nap, working on the computer in these conditions was too difficult. I wanted to nap too, to rid myself of a headache, but I preferred to keep watch. <img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_04.jpg' alt="pino the sailboat at anchor, not enjoying the wind waves" loading='lazy'></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Later, the forecast changed yet again, down to 15-25 kn. The motion at anchor became tolerable, cooking dinner without fear of feeling sea sick would be possible. I cooked some sticky brown rice with a topping of sweet and sour chickpeas with crushed peanuts on top. The wind was howling in the strait, but it wasn't felt as strongly here. The wind left entirely at 1700, allowing us to sleep well. We are always grateful when the wind goes to sleep too.</td>

    <td><b>Secretary Islands to <a href='smuggler_cove.html' class='local'>Smuggler Cove</a></b><hr><br>We awoke to an even quieter quiet. A lonely log drifted past, a bald eagle sat atop a bare tree top, a dog barked, the echo distorted the bark of the dog, making it appear like it belonged to a larger, more ferorious animal.<br>We left our unnamed nook at 0830, motoring towards Porlier Pass to catch it at its quietest. Porlier Pass can run fast at peak current, but like all rapids, when timed right, the waters are smooth. Today, the waters were undisturbed. We passed a log supporting 12 black-headed gulls, we named them: the black-headed gull syndicate. This log was <i>the</i> place to be, this is where shady decisions in the black-headed gull world happened.<img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_05.jpg' / loading='lazy'>A small fishing boat idled in the pass in the shallows, we glided past them, hoping to find a rippled sea in the strait. Ripples were indicative of wind. The forecast had been unreliable, what was supposed to be 10-15 kn out of the southeast, turned into wind that was supposed to die entirely at 1000, not long after our exit from Porlier Pass. Wind was forecast in the north part of Georgia Strait, so we thought we'd go out and find it. We spotted a band of darker water on the horizon, there <i>was</i> wind out there, but we had to push further away from the shore to reach it. We met with the rippled band of water, hoping that it would stay rippled, it did, with many more bands ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Our plan was to skirt along the length of Galiano Island, if the wind did not manifest we would duck into Gabriola(another island, further north). The wind stayed, so we pushed on.<br>10-15 kn winds out of the southeast carried us all the way across. The wind did lessen at times, but it always increased again to fill our sails. The day started grey, and stayed grey. Our new rain jackets saw their first rain today. Our former foulweather gear would get wet and stay wet, making any sail in the rain uncomfortable, while our new vinyl bibs and jackets kept us dry. Although, keeping our hands dry and warm at the same time was a problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
    <td>It was difficult to see the Vancouver mainland with this rain. In the absense of a visual reference, we had to follow our compass. We took turns steering Pino. When we spend long days on the water we have to give the other time to rest, to warm up. Most Alaska-bound sailors favor boats with enclosed cockpits, but Pino's cockpit is always exposed to the weather. The rain, the sun, and the wind always find us. Both of us were dry today, but it was cold, we hadn't layered on enough clothes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>When we arrived at the entrance to Smuggler's Cove it was 1600, both of us were spent, our defenses eroded by the prolonged exposure to the rain and cold. In such conditions, our bodies have to work extra harder to keep us warm, burning more energy. "My tank is low." Just as I'd said this, the rain increased, bringing the morale onboard to a newfound low. We dropped the hook in the middle basin, not bothering to stern-tie to shore.<br>Devine fired up the woodstove while I secured gear in the cockpit and on deck, determined not to have to go back out there once I tasted the warmth of the cabin. We ate a hearty rice noodle soup, it warmed our insides, while the woodstove took care of our outer shells. Our plan for tomorrow was to go to the grocery store in Pender Harbour. In our haste to leave Victoria, we forgot to stock up on a few key ingredients, like olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. The grocery store there, we knew, had excellent baguettes in stock.<br>A singlehanded sailor came into the anchorage at 1900, he decided to stern-tie, even if there was room, even if it was raining buckets.<img src="../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_06.jpg" alt="a drawing of smugglers cove, showing some boats at anchor, as well as islets and shoals" loading="lazy"></td>

    <td><b>Smuggler's Cove to Pender Harbour</b><hr><br>The wind kept us awake last night. Southeast winds funnel through Smuggler's Cove. Our swing radius was very limited in this bay, when the anchor rode was taut, we were 18 m (60 ft) away from the shore. We assumed a southeast wind would point us toward the outer basin. Swinging that close to shore doesn't ever stop being worrisome. We were awake from 0100 to 0400. After 0400, the wind lessened, our anchor watch was over, we fell asleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>We woke up at 0700. We've experienced big weather while anchored in this bay before, but whenever a detail changes, like anchoring somewhere new in the same bay, it is difficult to have complete trust. Our boat is infinitely valuable to us, sleeping badly is a small price to pay, and we can catch up on sleep later.<br>We could see our own breath because of the cold. We prepared whole wheat pancakes for breakfast, while firing up the woodstove.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>We left Smuggler's Cove at 0930, riding the tide north to Pender Harbour, a short 10 NM hop away. The sun came out during our transit, warming our bodies, a reminder that the world could be warm, that it could have color in it. Some clouds drew shapes on Texada Island, while others, heavy with water, threatened to burst. We spied a large cloud with a skirt of rain, south of us, the wind was helping it along, it too had Pender Harbour in sight. We hoped to arrive before it reached us.</td>

We always leave with backup anchorages in mind, some for if the wind is helpful, others for if it isn't.<br>We forgot to buy a small axe while in Victoria, we considered looking for one in Pender Harbour but there were no hardware stores within reasonable walking distance — much of British Columbia is car-centric. We hope to find one in Port McNeill, a city near the top of Vancouver Island. We would use the axe to split our own kindling for the woodstove, wood sold in stores is usually not sized for our little 23x23 cm firebox. Mornings are still very cold aboard Pino, we run the woodstove to stay comfortable.</td>

<tr> 
    <td>We left the dock at 1000. The wind funneled into the Harbour, a sign that there was a lot of weather out there. We put a reef in, beating to weather under a full sail can get really sporty. We inched out of the Harbour by motor, and sailed as soon as we cleared the outermost island and begun a seemingly infinite succession of tacking, with one coast fading away while the other came into focus. On each tack, our eyes found a landmark to aim for across the channel. Every lighthouse, old cannery, cliff face or clear-cut area on a mountain, acted a a marker and a proof of our progress.<br>We had to tack 6 times to line up with the entrance to Ballet Bay, our planned anchorage of the day.</td>

    <td>We saw two other sailboats on the water today. One of them, a catamaran, beat us to our anchorage, while the other sailed on. At times, we were going at 6 kn, a fine speed under a reefed mainsail. The boat was heeling to 20 degrees, a good test for our gimballed stove. We have used it everyday since we left.</td>

<tr>
    <td>Once we arrived into Ballet Bay, we saw that the catamaran had claimed the shallows, but we found a spot nearby in 13 m (45 ft, 16 m / 55 ft at HW). The northwest wind found its way into the bay, but there were no waves at least.<br>We prepared sandwiches with a baguette we picked up in Pender Harbour. I was glad to have waited to arrive to eat, some meals are unpleasant to eat underway. When the wind and the waves are up, I feel like I have to finish the meal in a hurry, I don't get to enjoy it.

In 13 m (45 ft) of water, all of the chain rode is out (we have 30 m / 100 ft of chain aboard), with a good length of rope rode hanging in the deeps. Pino does not have a windlass aboard, we haul everything up by hand, or by using a chain hook and leading a line back to a cockpit winch. The chain stopper at the bow locks the chain, permitting us to adjust the chain hook safely. We can't use the same technique for the rope rode, though. Up until now, we did it by hand, but that won't be possible in depths greater than 18 m (60 ft), which we'll likely encounter up north. Our plan was to tie a prusik knot around the rope rode to haul it in (read more about it in <a href='no_windlass.html' class='local'>no windlass</a>).</td>

    <td>This is not the fastest, or easiest method of hauling an anchor rode, but it works. Today, the wind was light, the water not too deep, we hoped it would continue to work well in more difficult conditions. Winches provide excellent mechanical advantage. A determined sailor could lift an anchor by way of a 4:1 pulley system alone, a technique <a href="https://roperescuetraining.com/index.php" target="_blank">rescuers</a> use, but winches are present on most boats our size. Motor boats too could benefit from having a winch onboard, especially in the event of a windlass failure, or to pull in a stern line in heavy winds. We've seen boats failing to secure their stern lines with wind on the beam because they lacked the strength to pull the line in by hand.</td>

    <td>After hauling all of the rode back on deck, we motored out of Ballet Bay to a calm Malaspina Strait. The forecast called for 5-15 kn out of the northwest. Sometimes this means 5, other times 15, but it is usually zero. I spied a dark blue band on the water ahead. "Either that's wind, or a tide line," I said, grabbing the binoculars, "Wind! Lots of it!" We raised Pino's wings, entered the blue band, and sailed, sailed, sailed! Then, shortly after, we reefed, reefed, reefed, because the wind was stronger than 15 kn(we cannot offer precise readings, because our wind meter died a long time ago). As we reefed the main, we accidentally heaved-to, which sent a few loose items rolling in the cabin.</td>

    <td>We zigzagged up Malaspina Strait. The wind lessened as we neared Sturt Bay on the northeast end of Texada Island. While moorage on this coast keeps increasing, the dock fees for the modest facilities at the Texada Boating Club continue to be reasonable, but we decided to try anchoring in the bay north of the docks for the first time instead. We later learned that the bottom was fouled with old logging gear. Texada Island's industry, consisting of both logging and mining, has mostly disappeared, but scars remain. Many bays on this coast are fouled with old machinery, we often see rusty cables and gear on land when hiking, posing as roots, half-buried in the soil and ferns.</td>

In the summer, a forecast of 5-15 kn will often mean no wind, but if the same numbers are forecast in the spring, the higher number is often more accurate. So far, we have sailed almost everyday. This was very different from the kind of sailing we'd done in these waters these past 4 years. We usually enjoy staying in the same anchorage for days, or weeks at a time. We will have to slow down once we arrive near open waters, stronger weather may not allow us to sail everyday — I am getting ahead of myself, eyes on tomorrow, Rek, eyes on tomorrow... well, eyes on tonight!

We planned to cross the rapids on the 12th of May, until then we had time to waste. Why the 12th? Because the turn to ebb was at a reasonable hour on a neap tide. Neap tides are the lowest tides of the lunar month, occurring in the second and fourth quarters of the moon. At this point in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is at its minimum, making it an ideal time to traverse through fast-flowing rapids. A small tide reduces the speed of the current.</td>

I tied the line to the crown of the anchor(many anchors have a hole pre-drilled for this, Rocnas have one). The fender squeaked and shifted uncomfortably as I tied the other end of the trip line onto it, as if to say, "you have <i>got</i> to be kidding!" The fender recalled the time we used it and 2 others of its kin to buoy our anchor chain while in French Polynesia. The 3 fenders were submerged, hovering in the depths, preventing the chain from getting caught in coral on the ocean floor.

Telegraph Cove was a safe place, shielded from the elements. We could observe the chaos from the safety of our little quiet nook, but we chose to leave.</td>

    <td>We added 2 reefs in the mainsail. We knew it was going to be rough, but 10 NM was nothing. The wind was tame, but got stronger as we approached Cormorant Island(lying between Telegraph Cove and Port McNeill). The passage south of Cormorant Island appeared narrow, difficult to tack through, so we decided to sail around the top.<br>It was <b>very</b> rough up there. The wind increased yet again, we had many waves leaping up on deck, our faces were quickly encrusted with salt and various sea things. Tacking in heavy weather is much more demanding. After tacking, I could never reel in the jib sheet back fast enough, the sail caught the wind too quickly, Devine had to point Pino's bow into the wind longer so I could manage it.</td>

 <tr>
    <td>By the time we sailed past Cormorant Island, the water was covered in white caps. We battled 20-25 kn out of the northwest, on the nose. It was a very harrowing ride, our path encumbered by both still and moving threats, shoals, reefs, the ferry to Sointula and Alert Bay. The ferry had time to pass twice, we had to tack to avoid it. We imagined the passengers aboard, watching our progress, seeing the sea as it was, thinking that we must <i>really</i> love sailing. Meanwhile, both of us wished we had listened to the crows and spent the night in Telegraph Cove, our cosy, calm nook. We had not considered wind against tide when we left the dock today, we're not sure why we didn't. "We are such fools," I thought. Our rain jackets were covered with salt, our faces were stiff, hardened by weather, the ride felt unending, like we'd been at sea for years. We assumed that the ledge north of Port McNeill would shield us from this wind, it didn't.<br>Pino's headsail is on a roller furler, in heavy weather, if we roll in the jib too tight it won't roll all the way, and if we roll it in too loose, or crooked, the wind will find a way in and cause part of the sail to balloon out while partially furled — this last bit happened to us today. While I was in the cabin on the radio trying to secure us a slip, the wind saw an opportunity to sneak into the loose bit of sail. "Oh shit!" I heard Devine say. We were very near the marina docks at the time, a terrible place for that kind of thing to happen. The wind pumped air into the top part of the furled sail, ballooning it out, the strong winds then caused the bulge in the sail to flail violently, shaking the entire rig in a very disconcerting way.<br>At that point unfurling the sail was impossible, the only way out of this mess was to do a full 360-degree turn with the boat to unroll the balloon in the sail, only then could we unfurl the sail again to secure it(this wasn't the first time since has happened to us). The jib was well-secured after that, we made sure of it. All of this happened 10 m (33 ft) away from the dock, it is not fun to have an audience when things go wrong.</td>

    <td>The only available spot in the harbour that day was at the municipal marina, the one most exposed to wind waves, laying outside the protection of the breakwater. The other marina was full up. "Blustery wave pool it is!" we said, as the wind brought us onto the dock. We added our line snubbers to the bow and stern lines to try and cushion the violent motion. The fenders were screaming with every wave, there was white foam everywhere, a storm was brewing in the gap between Pino and G dock.<br>We had come to Port McNeil to re-supply, but also to relax, this wasn't relaxing. When inside the cabin, it felt like being at sea. Being at anchor might have been a better choice, but moving was not possible now, Pino was pinned to the dock by wind and waves. We had made a lot of bad decisions today.<br>After paying our moorage, Devine desperately wanted time off the boat, we went for a walk in town to the grocery store. We bought a baguette, cucumbers and carrots. "Fuck it," I said, "let's buy some pre-made hummus." We never buy pre-made hummus, we always make our own, but today we were tired and hungry. I then saw the price of a small tub of hummus, "we... are making our own hummus!"</td>

    <td>When we arrived back to the chaotic mess that was our home, I went to work quick-cooking some chickpeas, I prefer to soak them overnight, but today we had decided on it late. I parboiled some dry chickpeas for 10 minutes, covered the pot, let them rest for an hour, then cooked them in the pressure cooker. For a moment, I wasn't sure homemade hummus was going to happen, because somehow I had lost the pressure cooker's little rubber vent plug, without it the cooker wouldn't hold its pressure. Luckily, I had kept the old one as a spare! I had replaced both the plug and the seal earlier this year, the seal was too worn to keep, but the plug was fine.<br>We ate our hummus, doing our best to ignore the weather outside.

"Yea, okay! Let's do it!" I said.<br>Conditions around most capes are bad in heavy weather, especially when ocean waves hit shallow waters near shore. This was true for Cape Caution, the waters shoaled to 9-15 m (30-50 ft) near the cape. To make matters worse, Cape Caution was preceeded by another danger: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slingsby_Channel" target="_blank">Nakwakto Rapids</a> — one of the fastest and most turbulent rapids in the world. When the channel is at peak ebb with an opposing wind, the contact between the two will generate very large waves in the north part of the strait.

We don't always wave to people on motor boats because we can't see them through the cabin windows, but sometimes people take the time to open a window, or pop out of the back to wave — a very sweet gesture. The motored vessels felt more alive, carrying people with stories, they weren't just noisy automatons following waypoints.</td>

We kept a close eye on our chart, to make sure not to miss a shoal, or a rock, waves dance overtop of them, waving to warn us, "I am here! Go Around!" The wind was tame, but the sea was messy, disturbed by the many obstructions in the water. Cutting through Catala Pass saved us a few sailing miles.</td>

Our chosen anchorage was 35 NM away, it was far, but manageable with good winds. Unfortunately, there weren't many good anchoring options in the area, the very good ones were far, the closest ones didn't offer protection from southerly winds or required careful timing on arrival because of rapids. The only safe place that wasn't too far from where we were was Bone Anchorage at the head of Racey Inlet on Princess Royal Island.</td>

The reefs did what they do best, continuing to lie in the way — such discourteous reefs. Getting away from the anchorage was dicey, one large wave threw us hard sideways, but we recovered quickly. We thought we had perfected the art of stowing items in big seas, but there was always one or two things that came rolling out to prove us wrong. "Hey, hey! Look at me!" they'd say. "No! Go back to your spot!" They never listen, and proceed to tumbling around the cabin floor, waiting for us to move them.<br>We motor-sailed until we were a bit further from shore, if we only sailed we ran the risk of drifting too far towards the shore.

The rain clouds brought stronger winds along with them. Luckily, I was prepared for both rain and cold! The rain jackets and bibs we got were PVC, they kept us dry. When our former foulweather jackets got wet, they stayed wet, but our new rainproof gear would dry very fast, so they didn't bring too much humidity inside the cabin. The only issue with those jackets was that they weren't warm, so today, we wore our other foulweather jackets under the waterproof coats — perfection.

Downwind, the rain hit our backs and wasn't bothersome, but now, it was soaking Devine's front. "UGH!" I ugh'ed back in agreement.<br>The rain fell very hard at times. I was partially hidden behind our mini dodger, navigating from there, my spot was a haven in comparison to Devine's exposed location. I offered to take turns.<br>To make matters worse, there as a bit of current against us in the inlet, slowing our progress, prolonging our time in the rain. The time to our destination felt like it stayed at 52 minutes for 3 hours, in reality, it took us a bit over an hour to arrive, but it felt like more in those conditions. When we create waypoints on our chartplotter, we can see the time left to our destination based on our current speed. It is sometimes reassuring to see the time we have left, but today, it was driving us mad.</td>

We passed a crab trap float, and could see the pull the water had on it, this is what we were up against. Even at anchor, the current kept our rope rode taut.</td>

The wind whistled in the rigging as it approached us from the stern. Lacking a wind meter, we cannot know the exact wind speed, but we could tell it was strong by listening. The following waves were impressive, pushing at our rear, the sky was dark too, making the scene feel all the more ominous.<br>I had an anxiety attack, maybe it was fatigue, but more likely it was the fear of big waves.

If it sounded big but wasn't, it still had the power to frighten me. I wasn't sure if this fear would persist, we hadn't seen proper ocean swells since that time. I might not have reacted this way if I had been tethered to the boat, I wasn't. The tether was what kept me attached the boat that last time. I should have had it on me already. Anyhow, Devine, kind and sweet and infinitely supportive, rushed out to steer as the squall passed. It gave me time to compose myself, the fear was still there, but the shock had subsided. Devine endured another squall later for me. Solid gold Devine.</td>

The narrowest part of the inlet had no wind, so we doused it there.<br>My hands were frozen when we arrived near the anchorage, they were red and sensitive. Reaching under the folded mainsail to secure it with a sail tie hurt like hell. I slipped my anchoring gloves on, gloves that were torn, salty, cold, wet and reeking of various sea things. I really needed to replace these gloves. I was fine using them in the Salish Sea, but it was struggle in colder waters, as was heaving chain hand-over-hand.

We always heard the sound of rushing water, from a fast-flowing river, or waterfall nearby.<br>But as always, the cold and wetness had worn us out. In Quebec, we say "avoir les deux yeux dans l'même trou," to say that we are very tired, it translates to "having two eyes in the same hole."

We knew we could report our arrival via an app(Roam), but again, our hardware was at fault, no device we owned could support it. The only way to tell them that we'd arrived was to step off the boat and to find a phone. We walked to the harbormaster's office, explained our situation and made the call. The CBP requested that we walk to their office downtown to finish the check-in process, a 45-minute walk away. The harbormaster was heading home for the day, she graciously offered to drop us off at the Federal building.<br>The federal building was salmon-colored, nested at the heart of downtown Ketchikan. Checking in was painless, the officer did not ask about fruit or vegetables onboard, in fact, they weren't going to come aboard at all. Books we had read warned us that the Ketchikan CBP would always board visitors on arrival, maybe they didn't want to come to the boat because of how late it was. They also didn't care that we didn't use the app, "our phone is too dumb, and our other devices are too old," we said. "I don't like having a computer in my pocket, so good for you!" one of the customs officers said to us.<img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_29.jpg'alt="A very old iphone complaining that they are too old for this shit" loading='lazy'></td>

This part of Southeast Alaska led to a bottleneck with many possible routes north, each route had its particularities.

The head of the inlet was very narrow, and with 33 m (110 ft_ of rope rode out, Pino was swinging far, very near the shore.

Devine had difficulty keeping Pino pointing into the wind, making it harder for me to hoist in the rode. Devine motored ahead to try and ease the tension on the line, but then the line was pointing straight back, we couldn't understand why, and I couldn't do anything. Devine had stopped going forward but the rode was still running along the side of the boat, pointing backwards. After a few moments of hectic experimentation, the line was freed and Pino was swinging at the end of the rode again.

We were meant to report our arrival to the CBP right away, but like in Ketchikan, our phone would not permit it. My plan was to, yet again, ask to use the phone at the harbour master's office. We suddenly heard a knock on the hull, a CBP officer was there, they had likely spotted us on AIS. We explained that we had not yet reported our arrival because of our phone situation, he was cool about it, and even offered to check us in early for our arrival in Petersburg, since apparently he was responsible for the reporting requirements in both cities.<br>We filled our stomachs with corn pone and chipotle peppers before going out.

    <td>A lot of tug boats towing large barges, commercial fishing boats and large passenger ships(like the Alaska ferry) use Wrangell Narrows. Some parts of the narrows were very constricted, and if a large ship was coming through we would have to get out of its way. The goal of the game was to constantly look behind, or ahead, and if a big vessel was coming, it was time to find a place to duck out of the channel to let them by. As soon as we left the anchorage, we saw a tug boat on AIS, a big one, pulling a very big load. We kept an eye on it as we proceeded through the narrows. It caught up to us near Green Rocks, we moved out of the channel and into the bight just east of Christmas Tree Rock to let it pass. We knew that this area was ahead, it wasn't too shallow, it had few rocks, a very good place to idle. It was powering north at 10 kts, pulling a heavy barge carrying containers, and construction vehicles. The tug pulling it was gargantuan.<img src="../media/content/travel/petersburg_02.jpg"><br>We encountered many more boats in Wrangell Narrows, mostly small run-abouts, or medium-sized cruising or fishing boats.

    <td>Like Blake Channel, this was the kind of channel where the current meets from the north and south between channel markers 44 and 50(what we refer to as the pinch, one of the narrowest points). To not have to suffer an opposing current, it was a good idea to time the northbound transit on the last of a flood. As the flood(south current) lessens to zero, if the boat is positioned where the north and south currents meet, the north current will start to ebb and carry us north. We knew we had to get to the pinch at 0940, we arrived at 0930. When you know your boat well, timing arrivals with precision is not too difficult, we always give ourselves a bit of extra time to make speed adjustments... because there is always something that happens that slows us down(like letting that tug pass).</td>

Slips in this harbor were not expensive.<br>Like in Ketchikan, transient boats were assigned to slips that the owners had temporarily vacated. The harbormaster assigned us a spot on the south side of the south finger in North Harbor. We were glad that they had assigned us to the north docks, that way we were closer to the harbour master's office, where the showers are. We were dying for a hot shower, our last one was in Prince Rupert. Because we arrived at the start of a rising flood, some current ran through the channel leading to the docks, and affected our steering. We could feel a slight current pushing us sideways as we went down the row of docks, but it wasn't strong enough, not yet, on large tidal exchanges it would likely be very difficult to get to a slip.</td>

Initially, our speed was good, but it then slowed as the current turned against us. The favorable current was at night, waiting until it eventually moved back into the day would cost us a lot of time, too much time. We had thought of heading towards Tracy Arm, but the forecasts for the area appeared too quiet and we didn't want to have to motor too much. We figured we'd have more wind if we moved towards Chatham Strait. We had our eyes on Sitka now, motoring would be necessary in that region because of Peril Strait, an area with rapids.</td>

I read Beryl Markham's West With the Night aloud to Devine as they steered in the rain and gloom. Reading about Nairobi, lions, and hot sands warmed our flesh. I read to Devine whenever it wasn't my time to steer, taking shelter from the light rain in the companionway.</td>

Because it appeared not to change, the way there felt unending, like we were standing still. I always wondered if maybe the current had suddenly risen against us, had immobilized us. Spending just 5 minutes inside the cabin was time enough to allow our eyes to register a change. No, this wasn't limbo, we weren't dead. Time sped up when we were away from the helm.</td>

This particular anchorage was bordered by tall mountains, one mountain was topped by a rock with a large hole in its middle — the eye of the mountain watches always.<br>Unfortunately, like Fanshaw Bay, the water here was 20 m (67 ft) deep. After some miscommunication with Devine when setting the anchor, I pinched the index finger of my right hand between the chain and chain-stopper. The right side of my finger turned a dull, grey, rather dead color, the discoloration spread to the area under my nail bed. Yuk.</td>

Contrary to the VHF forecast, one of the wind models seemed to indicate wind for tomorrow, light in the morning and building to 10-15 knots out of the southwest throughout the day. Ideal. We weren't sure which weather authority to trust, but we would give it a shot. We needed some calm to round the southwest corner of Admiralty Island before sailing north into Chatham Strait. Frederick Sound was often devoid of wind anyway, we expected to have to motor to the corner to catch a worthwhile breeze.

They liked wet and grey mornings, when the weather was hot they'd vanish and the horseflies would take their place. No weather in this region was safe from biting insects.<br>A rain cloud followed us out of the anchorage, but never reached us. Fog began to form in southern Chatham Strait, snaking along the southern shore of Frederick Sound. For now, it was a distant concern for us. We passed the lighthouse on the southwest point of Admiralty Island, then switched off the engine, determined not to use it again until we reached our planned anchorage at the entrance to Peril Strait. The wind was light at first, but with the current in our favor we progressed northward at a good speed.</td>

 <td>We sailed up to the latitude of Cut Throat Creek, halfway up Catherine Island. The land diverted the wind from our port and over to our starboard stern quarter a few times. Downwind sails were always nice, the motion was calm, we could enjoy hot drinks without fear of spills, the pull on the tiller was weak. We missed wind like this. We kept our promise and sailed most of the way, but we arrived at the mouth of Peril Strait a bit later than we had planned, the current turned at 1600, just as we'd reached the south of Thatcher Point. By the time we motored through Thatcher Channel, we had 0.60 knots of current running against us, and it would continue to rise until 1800 if we didn't hurry. Calcifer did its very best, but in the end we decided to forego anchoring in Hanus Bay in favor of the Eva Islands. Motoring to our planned anchorage with an opposing current was not very appealing, and as I said earlier, fog was waiting for us in the strait up ahead.<br>As well as being unplanned, this was place 22 m (72 ft) deep at high water, the deepest we had anchored in so far. Once at 60 m (200 ft) of rode, paying it out was difficult, the rope rode was too light and didn't want to leave the boat. It kept twisting, laying limp in the water. Paying out the chain was easier because of its weight, rope rode was ok too usually, but when the required length exceeded 53 m (175 ft), I had to force it off the boat. We set the anchor in less rode, then paid out the rest to meet the highest possible tide while aiming for a ratio of 3:1(that is usually enough for our boat, unless big weather was coming.</td>

Although, it was difficult to relax because as soon as we arrived in the Eva Islands anchorage, Pino was under siege. Hundreds of biting midges were hovering outside, we couldn't get out of the cabin, and somehow, despite having insect screens on every hatch, they were finding their way inside. For a while we had at least 50 hovering indoors. We stuffed rags in all of the possible openings, and Devine taped over tiny cracks while I crossed swords with the soldiers already inside our space. We were battleworn, tape was our last ditch effort to secure our fort against these fiends. "I don't know how we're going to raise the anchor in the morning tomorrow," I said, exasperated, "if their numbers hold..."<br>We usually had 10-20 to contend with at once, but tonight the air outside was thick with them. Fly-induced nighttime. We didn't usually have to contend with such enormous swarms. Keeping mosquitoes and horseflies out was never an issue, but these things could walk through tiny cracks. In the end, our desperate, but aggressive fortifications were sufficient, the insect world and Pino's cabin were separate again. We scraped many tiny bodies off the walls, and went to bed.</td>

I needed to go out to transfer 20 L of diesel into our tank, but seeing the reduced swarm gave me courage. I ventured outside, but when I entered the cockpit I saw that it was completely littered with tiny bodies, the entire army had perished overnight. The corpses were concentrated around the sliding boards, near the crack in our companionway door screen that had briefly served as a biting midge highway yesterday(before we taped it up). Pino's deck was speckled with them. Some survivors took to the air, ready for another round, I did my best to drive them off. I had covered most of my skin, I had a tuque drawn down over the top half of my face down to my eyes, gloves... everything. My hands were occupied with the diesel transferring process, and so I fended off my attackers by blowing air at them.<br>The refill operation was a success, although they kept landing on my head and shoulders, away from my mouth... clever fuckers.

Although Devine woke up with some kind of indigestion, they weren't feeling well, so I steered Pino, with plans to continue to steer all the way to our next anchorage should their condition not improve. Devine slept in the cockpit while I got us through the eastern half of Peril Strait. For now, I was aiming towards Appleton Cove, a short 12 NM ride away. Going far didn't make sense if my sailing partner was ill. Luckily, the nap cleared whatever was ailing Devine, and they decided that they felt ok enough to go all the way to Baby Bear Bay, 29.9 NM away. We thought the current would help us get there faster, but it did not add to our speed.<br>A cruise ship, 4 power boats, and a fishing boat all went passed us. Once near Nismeni Cove, a humpback whale surfaced at our bow, and so we put the engine in idle. It swam by close, past our starboard side and around our stern. Whales swim with such ease, with such elegance, our whale friend joined another of their kin further away.</td>

The water here was disturbed, with many back eddies swirling around us which would send Pino sliding one way, then the other. The current was very strong here, and stayed strong all the way to Baby Bear Bay. The most disturbed waters lay between Rapids Point and Yellow Point. It was intimidating to enter such waters, our speed neared 7.5 knots at times. We encountered a back eddie near the Middle Point red channel marker that slowed us down to 3.4 knots. This reversal stayed with us all the way to the entrance to Baby Bear Bay. Some motor boats that were ahead of us went to anchor in Deep Bay, a place with anchoring room for large boats.<br>The entrance to Baby Bear Bay was fringed with reefs and bull kelp, but the charts were correct and we managed well enough. It was near high tide when we arrived, with the current running at max ebb in Sergius Narrows. At first glance, it looked like no one else was anchored here, we aimed for the cosy nook in the northwest corner, but when we drew near it we saw that it was occupied by a small motor boat. We anchored further out in 12 m (40 ft, max high tide). It feels nice to anchor in shallower waters, for once. We arrived at 17h30, Devine lit a fire and prepared a pumpkin soup for dinner.</td>

The motor boat left at 0830, while we stayed put to catch slack tide at Sergius Narrows at 1518. It was a very late time to leave, but passing at slack was the smart thing to do in turbulent areas. We hoped to get to Sukoi Inlet tonight, 12.5 NM away. It wasn't too far, but something always happens to hinder our progress.

The path was so clear yesterday, but today there was no way around it, we had to plow through, this was likely because the current and tides were different. We hate having run our engine through kelp, it's risky, we don't want to risk fouling the prop... especially in an area with lots of rocks and high currents.<br>The wind was blowing from the ocean entrance channel, making the water in the area extremely choppy. We hadn't expected this, the wind was curling into the passes as a southwest wind. This wasn't good, because we also had to fight the last of the opposing current to get to Sergius Narrows. Fucking sigh. Other boats were rushing towards it too, but weren't struggling because all had more engine power than we did.<br>A tug and barge appeared on the horizon at our stern. We maneuvered out of its way, staying out of the main channel to allow it to pass, but the tugboat captain hailed us on VHF to tell us to get out of the way. We were confused by this, because we could see the tug's position in relation to ours on AIS and that we weren't in the way. We moved further out of the channel to make it clearer that we weren't trying to proceed into the narrows. By that time, we were barely moving, just idling on the side of the channel, but he hailed us again, asking us to move further, so... we did. What else was there to do? When the tug finally passed us, there was more than enough room, we could have stayed where we were, but in moments like these, it's better to take their word for it.</td>

This sort of thing always happens at the worst possible time. We turned Pino around to have the wind at our stern, we opened the jib and ran downwind. When I opened the engine room, I felt the immense heat, the engine was crazy hot, and sweating, I couldn't get near it. Passing Kakul Narrows to get to Sukoi Inlet was not going to be possible today, it wouldn't be safe. We instead turned towards Piper Island with plans to troubleshoot the engine's problem at anchor. We think that it was likely that the engine was overworked.<br>We sailed over to Piper Island, our 15-foot oars were assembled and waiting the cockpit, should we need them. Once we arrived on the other side of the island we would lose the wind and would have to row to get to a suitable anchoring spot. We were nervous, because there were many shoals around the island to avoid. Unfortunately, 2 other boats were there at anchor, restricting space in an already very small anchorage, we had to make it past them. Some gusts curling around the island permitted us to move faster than we could using the oars. We made our way to the northeast end of the island. This place was less sheltered, but there were no other options. We dropped our anchor in 9 m (30 ft).</td>

   <td>Once at anchor, I went below again to try and fix the issue. The engine was a bit cooler now, so I was able to check the oil level, the water strainer, etc. The oil level was fine, but I found a bit of algae in the strainer, maybe the fact that the engine was hot was due to the water flow being restricted? But I thought it curious that the overheating alarm hadn't gone off first. The wind will be a bit less tomorrow, it will be easier to exit Kakul Narrows.

It had not been 5 years yet, and we don't motor that much.

Devine used the boat hook to tear it off.<br>The engine seemed to let out a normal amount of water, we ran it in gear for a little while, but weren't sure if this was enough to recreate yesterday's problem.</td>

After looking at the forecast, we decided that leaving tomorrow was better, the wind wouldn't be as high.<br>Our plan was to sail down the coast non-stop for a few days to get to Dixon Entrance, to experience overnight sailing again. We thought this option preferable to coastal hopping, because anchorages here were far apart, and having to arrive somewhere on time, before dark, was stressful. Another reason we wanted to do this was because we were both concerned with our little engine, doing more miles in open water by sail would be safer for us.</td>

Visitors took photos of the many totem poles, quickly, in passing, without really taking them in with their own eyes, and without bothering to read the accompanying plaques. Strange.<br>We decided to take the long way back to Pino to avoid the crowds in town. While walking there, we saw signs reading: "Small Town Soul, no more tour buses!" We looked it up once we arrived back home. <a href="https://smalltownsoul.org/" target="_target">Small Town Soul</a> was a group that formed with the aim of ensuring that Sitka wouldn't become overrun with tourists by limiting the amount of cruise ships that could come, with the well being of locals in mind. Towns consumed by overtourism lowers the quality of life of its residents, it transforms the city, sometimes in really awful ways, like with the overabundance of jewelry stores in Ketchikan. Sitka was not yet corrupted by over-tourism, but it could happen if people didn't take steps. Good luck, Sitka residents.</td>

There were 2 cruise ships broadcasting on AIS, we could make them out in the fog, but their outlines were faint. For a while it appeared that our paths would converge, but they soon turned away — phew!

I don't know how many whales today, so many whales! So many that we stopped calling out sightings to each other. We saw lots of black-footed albatrosses too, and some puffins! When sailing past the Hazy Islands, we could hear seals from afar, the islands were also home to a colony of seabirds. When downwind of the islands, we could also smell them. We had a bit of opposing current between the Hazy Islands and Coronation Island, but it wasn't too bad, it only affected us more because the wind got a bit light.</td>

Port Bazan was the closest anchorage, lying 24 NM away. We turned and aimed for it, there was no sense in throwing ourselves into hazardous conditions. Although I was also concerned about having to use the engine to get into the anchorage, that was potentially hazardous too. At least, we knew we could sail into it, the wind was pointing into the entrance. But we hoped that conditions would also allow us to leave... now <i>that</i>, was scary to think about.</td>

At least, the entrance pass was wide, and we would have a chance to observe conditions from afar with binoculars, to see if we saw breaking waves in the entrance... we'd make up our mind about entering then. Anchorage entrances that open onto an ocean are always tricky. Port Bazan had both a north, and south entrance, we would be entering via the north pass, and hoped to leave again with the south pass, the orientation would <i>maybe</i> make it easier to leave...</td>

We were under sail alone, no engine. We had tried turning it on as a safety earlier, we had kept it in idle, but the oil pressure alarm rang and we had to keep it shut. Our planned anchoring spot was 2 NM away. The wind helped us through the pass and into quieter waters, but the deeper we went, the less wind there was to help us, and so, as a safety, we assembled our two giant 15-foot oars, and installed them into the cockpit winches. As the wind left us entirely, we proceeded to row Pino forward.<br>It was really, really hard, and slow. It was 1000 by then, the sky was getting dimmer and dimmer, and the biting midges were out for blood. They were attacking any bit of exposed flesh.

Torture, that's what it was, we were in Dante's hell.<br>While slowly rowing forward on calm waters, we kept the jib unfurled, in case the wind returned. Thankfully, some light, but unreliable, gusts helped us gain a bit more speed. In that moment, we were glad to have another way of moving Pino forward, other than with the sails, even if it wasn't efficient. It saved us.</td>

I woke up feeling anxious about our situation, but also eager to get to work on finding the problem. I also had to accept that maybe we wouldn't be able to fix it, and if that was the case, we had to have a plan. Could we get out of Port Bazan without an engine? What happens then if we <i>do</i> leave, getting into Prince Rupert to check back into Canada without an engine was going to be just as difficult, there was a lot of traffic there, lots of obstructions, too. At this moment I had even considered us sailing non-stop to Victoria from here(Canada really has too few check-in ports when coming in from offshore waters).<br>My mind was very good at thinking up different scenarios, at planning ahead to keep us safe, but it also had the power to overwhelm. There was such a thing as 'having too many plans', my brain now felt clogged up, unusable. "What a <b>shit</b> superpower..." I thought, while crying. The pressure had built up inside of me, I had blown a gasket. Really though, I knew it was because I was still tired, and also because we still hadn't eaten anything. To try and remedy this, we made pancakes for breakfast. I wasn't very hungry, stress had a way of making my stomach feel full, but I forced myself to eat.</td>

<tr>
   <td>After breakfast, we went to work on the engine. Our plan was to check all of the cooling lines, both the freshwater and raw water lines, and to check the thermostat. We drained the coolant, removed the thermostat, and spent a while scraping the old gasket off. Our reason for removing it was because we'd had a cooling problem like this before with our old Yanmar 2GM. Because we had no replacement gasket in stock, we put some gasket maker(liquid sealant, made to withstand the heat of an engine) and sealed the space again without a thermostat. Running without a thermostat was not ideal, but we didn't have a replacement, and our engine was running too hot, so running cold for a while ought not be too dramatic, it might just mean that it wouldn't run at peak efficiency... but really, right now it just needed to run. We replaced the coolant.</td>

    <td>We then proceeded to remove one raw water hose at a time, starting the engine, and having the water from that particular section of hose empty into a bucket, to see if the flow of water was restricted at that point. We shut the engine each time we tested a new section of hose, all the way to the anti-siphon valve. Then, we inspected part of the exhaust elbow, we left it on the engine head because we didn't have a replacement gasket, and we knew it was a finicky one. Everything ran fine, no blockages. We ran the engine in gear, but again, we had no issues. This didn't mean that all was okay though, we've had many false positives in the past, but it was possible that we had fixed it. Our engine manual mentioned that a faulty thermostat could cause white smoke.<br>We closed the engine room, hoping for the best. We cleaned up the mess we'd made from working on the engine, and then tried to relax a little. The weather today was nice, and warm. There were sea otters everywhere.

There was plenty of water coming out the exhaust, and a normal amount of smoke. Once outside of the pass, we had to motor a bit further to get away from shore. We could see there was wind ahead, just not near shore. Once we reached it, we shut the engine down. Phew, it behaved this time... maybe, just maybe we had fixed the problem after all.

The ocean was not a gentle dancing partner today. Some current was coming into Dixon Entrance from Cordova Bay, even small opposing currents could cause swells to turn into high peaks and low valleys. I did my best to ignore their size, Pino needed to stay in sync with their movements, falling out of step could be dangerous out here.<br>While on break, Devine was in the cabin below reading Santoka, but took over for me at 2100.

Our wind meter continued to be dead, but we instead  looked up at the arrow on the top of the mast to gauge the wind direction. At night we shined a bike light onto it. The arrow had reflectors which made it easy to see where it was pointing.

Our lagoon was a safe place to weather this kind of wind, but being patient was hard. Having to wait to make progress was hard. If the wind eased up a bit, we'd have to sail into it, but it was tricky to do in open water, the sea state can really stifle windward progress.<br>In all, waiting was only tolerable if there was a known fixed end to the waiting. Northbound sailors must be delighted, this wind would carry them far, and fast. A bad wind for me was a good wind for someone else out there. It was likely that we would have to contend with south winds until we reached McInnes Island.</td>

They had supplies, and weren't in immediate danger.<br>When receiving their coordinates, we turned around and began to motor northwards towards their position. We were motoring against the current though, making for very slow progress, but it was fine, because MK had climbed up a hill to get good reception and needed time to get back to sea level to pack up their gear. The plan was to meet at a peninsula nearby, and for them to paddle over to us once we were in sight from shore.

We didn't want to risk MK missing us and paddling further into open waters in these conditions. MK's radio calls weren't clear, and it seemed like there had been some confusion because they were paddling to us from further north. We had understood that their gear was waiting at the peninsula, it wasn't. MK would have to paddle a long while to get to us.<br>Meanwhile, we were sitting still, bobbing in the waves. When we asked for status updates, MK said they were paddling at 3 knots toward our position, we motored a bit further north to cut some distance to meet up with them, but visibility was nil, and there were reefs everywhere. I was incredibly nervous. We decided that this was too foolhardy, so we asked that they return to shore and wait for better conditions.</br>By then, the Canadian Coast Guard had come into contact with a rescue boat out of Hartley Bay, and informed us that it was coming to pick up MK. Since MK's radio didn't have good transmission range, a fishing boat anchored nearby relayed their messages back to the Coast Guard. Once we knew that the fast rescue boat was underway, we pointed back south again. It was better, in all, for MK to go to Hartley Bay. They could arrive in town today, and repair their kayak, or catch a ride elsewhere. Pino was a slow boat, it likely would have taken us 3 or more days to get to a city. We kept an eye on the position of the rescue boat with AIS, to make sure MK was picked up.

I placed the pump hose onto the thruhull opening, over the hose barb, holding it down with one hand because it wasn't a perfect fit, while blocking the pump's air intake with another hand.

There was no VHF reception for weather here, so we downloaded the McInnes Island to Pine Island weather forecast webpage using the <a href='satellite_phone.html' class='local'>satellite phone</a>. Being able to request webpages was pretty cool, but it was necessary to have the exact URL on hand already. The contents of the page were converted to text-only, thankfully it wasn't too messy. We had plans to move a bit more south tomorrow, before the strong southerlies started up again on Sunday.</td>

As I hauled in the rode, Devine was gesturing towards me, asking me to come join them in the cockpit. "Look! Over there! A bear!" I secured the rode, and joined Devine near the stern to look at the scene. A bear mom and cub were swimming, they had just left a small islet, and were heading towards the King Island shore. "Ohhhhh wooooooow!" I said, reaching for the binoculars inside the cabin. This was our first ever bear sighting. We had given up on seeing a bear, and now, there were two right there in front of us! They were so damn beautiful, I could have cried. We had time to take in their features. They surfaced for a brief moment on a drying reef, scaring away all of the birds that had been perched on it; they soon went back into the water and disappeared into the trees ashore. Magical.<br>We waited until they were out of sight before turning on the engine, neither of us wanted to disturb this scene.</td>

While motoring along, I suddenly smelled something awful, like there was a propane leak... a big one. I smelled inside the cabin. Nothing. The propane locker? Nothing. The smell was outside. Then, I saw a whale spray near us. "Christ. I think the whale farted, or maybe it had a shit?" The whale was laying near the surface, letting out an occasional spray. This behavior, we later learned, was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_surfacing_behaviour#Logging" target="_blank">logging</a>. Apparently, the smell was also due to us being close enough to smell its <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/this-is-what-whale-breath-smells-like" target="_blank">breath</a>. Whale breath was described by National Geographic as <i>"...an unholy mingling of fart and fishiness—hundreds of gallons of air forcefully expelled from its lungs, laced with the fumes of half-digested krill, hundreds of pounds of these slow-dissolving crustaceans fermenting in its stomach."</i><br>The wind came up as we neared Hakai Passage, helping us sail to Kwakume Inlet.</td>

The rock was easy to see, a large seal was laying on it. The seal stayed until the tide rose enough that it had set them afloat. For a while, as water covered up the whole rock, it looked like the seal was just laying on top of the water.

After dinner, I emptied the little bowl of seawater I had placed under the engine. The seawater cooling pump was leaking, the seal needed replacing and we didn't have a spare, for now, emptying the bowl after every motoring session was good enough. I preferred not to let the water drain into the oil pan where it could mix with other things, like oil or fuel droplets. The fuel bleeding screw was still leaking too, so I put a small pad to absorb the fuel overtop of the screw. This engine would require a lot of maintenance after this trip...</td>

"Get to the bit relevant to where we are... come on, come ooon!" We knew other people benefitted from hearing the other bits, but it did little to suppress our whining. What was most frustrating was that sometimes when arriving at the weather bit useful to us, the signal would break, or become noisy, making the forecast undecipherable, then we had to listen to the whole damn thing once again.<br>Reception wasn't 100% clear in many anchorages, we often had to listen to long moments of noise before the radio voice came through clearly again. To save on time, I liked to cook as I was listening to a broadcast, I stopped when the bit I needed came up. I would write down the changes in a notebook, and update them with the new weather as it was released. Sometimes the weather changed dramatically, especially in times of disturbed weather.

"Where was the storm?!" we yelled, quoting The Dresser, a movie we both quite liked. "A collision of cotton balls!"<br>2 cruiseships went by, heading into Johnstone Strait, sending us flying in their wake. The people on those ships would arrive in Victoria tonight, while it would take a boat like us days to do the same trip. We lived at a very different pace.</td>

<tr>
  <td>We hit some kind of countercurrent when south of the Hanson Islands(um-bop!), which slowed us down a ton for about an hour. It appeared as though we wouldn't make it to Port Harvey today. We aimed for Boat Bay instead, a tiny bay offering fair protection from the wind in the strait(not from southeast, though). We didn't have many options, so we thought we'd try it. We felt a west wind when near Boat Bay, but it wasn't strong, not yet. We saw some tents laid ashore when we arrived, there were people camped out on elevated wooden platforms. There was also an inflatable boat moored onto a floating dock in the lee of Swain Point. We could hear someone cutting wood with a chainsaw.<br>We anchored in 9 m (32 ft). Some breeze did make it into the bay, but nothing crazy. Checking the weather buoy at Fanny Island, I could see it was blowing 25 knots down south. The wind funnels a lot further south, as Johnstrait becomes more constricted by land. We were looking forward to good sailing wind, something we thought that the upcoming part of Johnstone Strait was sure to offer us. We wanted to have Pino move faster than 3.5 knots. At this point, Pino's bottom was really dirty though, we knew that didn't help. The algae beard was back, in strength...<img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_38.jpg' alt="pino looking very happy to have an algae beard, why we tell them not to be happy about it" loading='lazy'></td>

   <td><b>Boat Bay to Forward Harbour</b><img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_41.jpg' alt="devine offering rek a cup of coffee saying cafe a l'eau" loading='lazy'>The wind was quiet last night, it was supposed to rise tonight, but we would be gone by then. We thought of aiming for Port Neville, or for Port Harvey. It was good to have options. We would leave at 1300. We would have to fight a bit of current for 1 hour, but we preferred to try to make progress earlier to arrive at our anchorage on time. At this hour, there was plenty of fog out there.</td>

  <td>I prepared lunch, but before I could finish I got a call from my mom! I knew what this was...! My younger sister had her baby! That same morning I had sent my sister a message, wishing her a happy birthday (because today was her birthday). Her baby was born on the same day as her! They would forever share a birthday! I thought this was amazing.<br>I talked to my mom and dad for a while, it helped to pass the time and to combat my usual pre-departure jitters.<img src='../media/content/travel/boat_bay.jpg' alt="anchored in boat bay in johnstone strait, a reef is visible, with fog covering far away mountains" loading='lazy'>We left Boat Bay right after the phone call. The wind had risen, it would help us overcome the contrary current. We put 2 reefs in the main, poled-out the jib, and off we went! The fog lay ahead still, but was slowly burning off. We motor-sailed at first, then when the wind rose enough we switched it off, enjoying the calm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>It had been a while since we'd had a proper sail. The fog burned off entirely by then. Because our speed was good, we bypassed Port Harvey. Another sailboat was sailing alongside us, under headsail alone, we were together for a really long time. When nearing Port Neville, the wind increased a lot. The wind was always stronger in this area. The white caps were quick to form. The Fanny Bay weather buoy reported 23 knots, with gusts to 28 knots. We had the wind in the back, so it was very manageable. We had put 2 reefs in for this area. We had read many condition reports recorded by this particular buoy, and had seen that between 1400 and onward, that the wind woud be high. We were zooming at 6.6 knots!<br>We turned into Sunderland Channel, the wind and waves chasing us through. We thought the sail up this channel would be more tame, but it was still very exciting! The wind kept on gusting, we were running under the mainsail alone now, the wind was a bit too offset for the jib to be out. Our speed was still 5.5 knots though, enough to get us to Forward Harbour before the current switched directions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Near the entrance to Forward Harbour, some seabirds lay in the water, moving only at the very last second. "Go around!" they seemed to say.<br>The anchorage was very busy, we had counted 8 boats, all were taking up the shallowest spots. We had to anchor in 21 m (70 ft) of water. There was no more room in anything below that line. We ate dinner at 2000, read a little, then fell asleep.</td>

   <td><b>Forward Harbour to Bickley Bay</b><hr>We woke at 0800, all our neighbors were gone. All of them. That's how it was around here, boats didn't stay long. The wind was lighter in the morning, so all of the boats likely wanted to head northward and not have to fight the wind to do it. The wind was set to rise to 30-35 knots later in the day. We planned to cross Whirlpool Rapids at 1400, then to make it to Greene Point Rapids with a current running(at a maximum of 3 knots) at 1730. We could probably get there before then, and would have to deal with far less current. In general, we preferred to run rapids at slack, but the area between the 2 rapids did not have many good anchorages, at least none that could grant us quick entry and exit(many were up-channel). We aimed to stop in Bickley Bay, 17 NM away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>While we waited for 1400, Devine pointed out to me that Cortes Island was only 35 NM away from here in a straight line. It was so close! But with many rapids yet to traverse, the road there was long, with many forced stops, and precisely timed arrivals and departures.<br>We had lunch, then proceeded to haul up the anchor. The wind had risen a little already, making the hoisting game a bit more challenging. I could only hoist the rope rode to 125 ft, then we had to use the cockpit winch to pull in the rest. We experienced a few snags today, like the rode getting caught in the anchor locker closing pin, then the chain to rode shackle getting stuck on the edge of the bow roller, well... not stuck, but we had to re-align it to get it to pass correctly. When there are big gusts, the boat jerks hard to starboard, or port, and we have to wait until the boat is better aligned with the wind again before resuming the rode hauling work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>After lifting the anchor, we raised the main with 2 reefs in it. The wind would not be gentle today. We proceeded over to Whirlpool Rapids, arriving at the turn of the current, as it started to flood(south) at slack tide. The wind was with us already then, at our stern. We poled out the jib, turning Pino into a very wide target once again. 2 boats were fighting the tide and the wind, heading into the other direction. We did not envy them.<br>As soon as we exited Wellsbore Channel, the wind and waves kicked up, hitting us on the beam. We rolled in the jib and let the wind carry us through Chancellor Channel. Our run up this channel was very fast. We had arrived 1 hour before peak flood current at Greene Point Rapids, with the current running at 2.8 knots. We went on through with no issues, we saw a few boils and small whirlpools, but nothing alarming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>The wind accelerated as we got near Bickley Bay, getting the mainsail down was a challenge. The bay was big, but open, and crab traps occupied the best anchoring spots. We had to anchor in 15 m (50 ft HW) of water. Because of the big winds, I put out a 4:1 anchoring scope, which turned out to be a great idea because it got very breezy! The wind circled around the point and swirled into the bay. We would get hit with powerful gusts every 10 minutes. We slept very, very badly, some of those gusts were scary. The wind was blowing at 30-35 knots in Johnstone Strait.<br>We had read in the Waggoner guide that the holding here was bad, but the anchor held all night despite that crazy wind. Anchoring in the Cordero Islands, or in Tallac Bay, might have been a better choice. Bickley Bay might have been fine in settled weather. We had already put a cross on stopping in <a href='shoal_bay.html' class='local'>Shoal Bay</a>, because we assumed the place would be too packed at this time of the year.</td>

   <td><b>Bickley Bay to <a href='hathayim_marine_park.html' class='local'>Hathayim Marine Park</a></b><hr>Waking up tired sucks. We crawled out of bed at 0830, lured out by the promise of coffee. We were 26 NM away from Hathayim Marine Park on Cortes Island, 26 NM away from an extended time of rest in a protected place, but we had yet another set of rapids to cross. The plan was to leave at noon, beat against a bit of current(1 knot max, the wind would help us overcome this), to arrive at Dent Rapids at 1517, so that we could in turn pass Gillard Rapids, then maybe the Yucultas. The tidal exchange wasn't big right now, so we thought we could pass all 3 in one go, like we had done on our way north.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>We left Bickley Bay at noon. I had prepared lunch ahead of time so it would be ready when we got hungry, that way we wouldn't have to cook while sailing. There was wind in Cordero Channel, and the current was not a problem. We progressed well, sailing past Shoal Bay, seeing with our own eyes that it was indeed very busy there, then past Nodales Channel. The wind stayed with us until we reached the Denham Islands, then we began to experience disturbed waters, and felt some of the effects of the dreaded Dent Rapids, laying ahead.<br>We pushed on at 2.5 knots, going slow, aiming to arrive at 1517. Other boats joined us, a few small motor boats, 2 big ones, and a sailboat. All went through ahead of us, but we arrived at Dent Rapids as planned. The waters were fine, smooth and only disturbed by wind. We ran wing-on-wing, the breeze propelled us through Gillard Passage. We arrived there 15 minutes after slack, but because the tidal exchange wasn't huge, we didn't struggle. We arrived on the other side in Big Bay, and saw that the public dock was full... no problem, the Yucultas were calm and we had eyes on Cortes Island!<br>We experienced zero disturbances in the Yucultas, and glided on into Calm Channel. The Yucultas were teeming with sports boats, idling on calm waters. There were also many float planes and helicopters whirring above our heads. We were officially back in busy waters again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>The wind only left us when we arrived at the north end of Read Island. From here, we could see the notch on Cortes Island, denoting the entrance to Hathayim Marine Park.<br>Calm Channel was such a gorgeous place, and the weather was just perfect. The surrounding mountains, flat waters, and the evening sky was such a comfort! We were back in familiar waters again, we knew every indentation in the land, all of the bights and bays. We saw boats stern-tied inside many of those bights, nested in quiet places on various small islands, away from the crowds and the noise. August was a busy time in Desolation Sound, boats that wanted to be left alone had plenty of nooks to choose from, weather permitting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>When near the top of Cortes Island, we saw a whale breaching, doing several tail slaps. Watching the whale action kept us busy, entertained, it helped to shorten the distance to the entrance. A light breeze started when we got near, reducing our cruising speed a little, delaying our arrival. Sometimes the wind helped, sometimes it didn't.<br>The sun was very low in the sky when we passed the B.C. Parks sign at the entrance. In the first basin, we could see a lot of boats lying at anchor. The outer and inner bays were packed. We motored around, looking for a Pino-sized gap amongst all of the moored boats. We found such a place, dropped anchor, and breathed a sigh of relief. We had done it. We had gone to Southeast Alaska and back. It was strange to share an anchorage with so many boats (there were about 40 around us). Boats here knew how to anchor close, while giving each other room to swing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>It was very dark by the time the anchor was down. While I was adjusting the rode at the bow, I could hear Devine inside, making popcorn. "Yesss!" I said as I tied off the rode, hurrying inside. "I am so ready for this!"</td>
<tr>
  <td><b>Note</b>: I did not document the rest of the trip to Victoria, but we returned there on October 1st 2024. The ride back was slow, we stayed near Cortes island for a few weeks, then stopped in many other anchorages.</td>

<p>Thank you for reading through this very long, very detailed account of our sail from Victoria to Sitka, and back. We hope that this re-telling of events has provided valuable insight into the kind of planning, timing, as well as both the physical and mental fortitude, required for attempting this kind of trip.</p>
