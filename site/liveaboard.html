<p>When living on the water, your home is always in motion, swaying with the currents and winds. Knowing that your vessel is not permanently tethered to the earth is a good feeling. It means you can go anywhere.</p>

<p>Our primary mode of transport has always been our <a href='bikes.html' class='local'>bikes</a>, they're quiet, and we're free to move myself around wherever, and whenever we want. Traveling by sailboat is taking this a step further. You can move yourself over from one continent to the other.</p>

<p>If you want to live in a sailboat you don't have to sail <a href='offshore.html' class='local'>offshore</a>. There is much to experience and see while staying in one country, and if ever you have the itch to leave you can do it. There are many benefits to having a floating home (see our <a href='buying_a_sailboat.html' class='local'>buying a sailboat</a> guide).</p>

<h2 id='cleaning_products'><a href='cleaning_products.html'>cleaning products</a></h2><p>When it comes to cleaning, polishing or abrading, you don't need a crazy arsenal of products. Below is a list of recommendations for household cleaning, or <a href='maintenance.html' class='local'>maintenance</a> aboard a boat.</p>
<table class='col' border='1'>
    <tr>
        <td><b>All purpose cleaner</b></td>
        <td>Mix of 500 ml hydrogen peroxide(3%) with 2.5 ml(40 drops) of lavender and lemon essential oils, and 0.6 ml(10 drops) of peppermint essential oil. Leave on surface for several minutes before wiping clean. Store in a dark-coloured bottle.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Chrome</b></td>
        <td>Apply apple cider vinegar on a soft cotton cloth to rub it clean. Then, use a fresh cloth with a dab of baby oil to make it shine.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Copper</b></td>
        <td>Make a paste of either lemon or lime juice and salt. Rub gently to clean.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Aluminum</b></td>
        <td>Cream of tartar and hot water. In a dish, add a few spoonfuls of cream of tartar, and stir in water to create a thick paste. Rub over the aluminum surface with a soft cloth.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Acrylic</b></td>
        <td>Use a mild dish soap. Mix about 1 L of water with a few drops of dish soap in a bowl, agitate to create suds. Dip cloth into mix, clean acrylic gently. Wipe with a clean, damp rag, and follow up with a soft, dry rag to collect leftover moisture.</td>
    </tr>

        <td>Dislodge debris with a scrubbing brush, rinse off with fresh water. For rust stains, make a paste of baking soda and water. Use a soft cloth and gently rub mixture onto the stain. Leave for 1 hour. For heavy yellow waterline and rust stains try Grunt emer-gel, a phosphoric acid-based product. Wear gloves while using it, as it is an irritant.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Wood dishes</b></td>
        <td>Wash with mild soap and warm water. Dry immediately after washing. Never soak in water or put it away wet. Every month, apply a coat of food-grade oil (we use coconut) to keep the wood moisturized.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Clothes</b></td>
        <td>Mix 2 cups of washing soda with the gratings from one 140 g bar of castile soap. Use 15 g for light loads, and 30 g for heavy loads. To whiten, disinfect, deodorize clothes of dish cloths, use sodium percarbonate at a ratio of 15 g per 5 L.</td>

<h2 id='carbonation'><a href='carbonation.html'>carbonation</a></h2><img src='../media/content/knowledge/carbonation.jpg' />

<p>We do enjoy having some fizzy water now and again, but hate to have to purchase bottles for it. We decided against getting a soda stream given the fact that its bottles are proprietary and cannot be filled by anyone other than them. Making your own system is way better, and if you've got a big tank it'll last for a long, long time.</p>

<p>Here's what you'll need to get, this is also the order in which you need to connect them together:</p>
<ul>
    <li>5KG CO2 tank</li>
    <li>A regulator</li>
    <li>1m of of vinyl tubing</li>
    <li>A ball-lock keg coupler</li>
    <li>A carbonator bottle cap</li>
    <li>A soda bottle (for carbonation with a reinforced bottom).</li>
</ul>
<p>For a full tutorial, check out this <a href='https://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2012-06/how-make-your-own-home-carbonation-system#page-4' target='_blank' class='external'>site</a>.</p>

<p>As of August 19th 2021, we have gotten rid of the large tank, because it is too big to carry. We're looking for a tank half that size that we can re-fill.</p>
<h2 id='privacy'><a href='privacy.html'>privacy</a></h2><p>There is no privacy on a small boat. It's something you must prepare for. If you have plans to travel for extended periods of time with another person, you must be compatible, you must discuss problems when they arise and express concerns right away.</p>
<p>The combined space, below and atop deck, is bigger than it seems. If you are near land, there is always the option of going for a walk.</p>
<h2 id='laundry'><a href='laundry.html'>laundry</a></h2><img src='../media/content/knowledge/laundry.jpg' loading='lazy' />

<p>In populated cities, we carry dirty clothes ashore to a laundromat. We have an extra large army surplus canvas duffle bag that is perfect to carry big bundles of clothes. If there aren't any facilities nearby, we do our own washing. We wash them by hand with <a href='rain.html' class='local'>rain</a> water using a set of buckets and a brush. The clothes dry well in the tropics, and during North American summers. Canadian winters don't allow for outside drying, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The sad fact is that all use of laundry soaps are toxic to sea life, even when bearing a label professing it to be "biodegradable" or "non-toxic". While the soap will eventually break down, it takes a while and can cause a lot of damage during that time. Phosphates, surfactants, triclosans, or any antibacterial ingredient, will do harm. According to the EPA, 28 ml (1 oz) of biodegradable soap needs to be diluted in 591 L (20,000 oz) of water to be safe for sea life. Washing clothes in plain water, with a good brush and a bit of white vinegar (diluted) can help freshen up clothes if there are no laundromats nearby, but in all, it might be better to wait to arrive at a facility to use soap.</p>

<p>For white clothes, or stained garments, we like to soak them in a bucket with some <a href='https://www.chemistrystore.com/sodium_percarbonate2.pdf' target='_blank'>sodium percarbonate</a>. It destains, deodorizes, whitens and is non-toxic to marine life. It breaks down to oxygen, water and sodium carbonate (soda ash) in your wash water.</p>

<p>When underway during long passages, we tend to wear the same clothes for a long, long time. If ever we do need to wash clothes, we'll do a quick salt water wash to save water, and rinse with fresh water. The clothes are hung out to dry on the lifelines, or on a separate line that we set up. Leaving dark clothes out to dry in the sun will cause it to discolour faster—such is the cost of sailing in warm places.</p>


<h2 id='moorage'><a href='moorage.html'>moorage</a></h2><p>Living at anchor, that is, in a bay somewhere tethered to the earth with <a href='ground_tackle.html' class='local'>ground tackle</a> is free. Some bays will have moorings installed that you can tie to for a small fee (often around $10-15 per day). Living at anchor is the cheap way to go, although getting a good anchor and rode is important as it will keep your boat safe.</p>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/marina.jpg' loading='lazy' />

<p>Marinas often have guest docks with power, WiFi and showers, for a medium-to-high cost ($300-$800.) The longer the boat though, the bigger the cost. Some marinas charge per dock space rather than boat size, beware of these places. Moorage near cities is more expensive, and the price goes up during the high season (summer). Winter moorage is generally much cheaper.</p>

<p>Paying for annual moorage is a good idea, but keeping a boat in a marina means getting liability insurance, which in turn, means you'll need a survey, resulting in a seemingly interminable domino effect which can incur many more costs. Depending on the age of your boat, and when it was last surveyed (if ever), you may need a full condition out-of-water survey. This means paying a marina to lift your boat out, and paying the surveyor. A surveyor will point out mandatory items that need fixing and/or replacing, if these items are not complied with within 60 days the insurance will be void.</p>

<p>Living aboard your boat will cause wear from regular use of the space. If staying at a marina in your home country for long periods, paying for <b>liveaboard fees</b> (up to $150 extra per month) is necessary. If staying in a marina in a foreign country, liveaboard fees are often waived. Some marinas charge for electricity and water, be sure to take that into account, especially if you have plans to winter there and that your heating is electric. In winter, marinas charge less than in the high season. A marina that charges 900$ per month in the summer can charge 500$ in the winter.</p>

<p>We prefer not to have too many overly specialized tools that we only ever use once every 3 years, like a rivet gun, a grease gun or a swage tool. In a boatyard, there is always someone who will have these, and we're certain that they'll be more than happy to lend them to you.</p>


<h2 id='bikes'><a href='bikes.html'>bikes</a></h2><img src='../media/content/bikes/01.jpg' />

<p>Devine's bike is a Trek District S(2014), with a travel ratio of 48/15(3.2), the tires are 700x25C(200g) and the tubes 700x18-25C with 48mm valves. They chose the aluminum wheel because it can be installed with an ilan key alone, it is made entirely of aluminum so it does not rust as much as the other less resilient lighter wheels they had.</p>

<p>Rekka has a Specialized Langster(2014), with the same wheel size and tubes as Devine's bike. It has an alloy frame and carbon fork, and a single fixed cog.</p>

<p>We use Abus foldable locks.</p>

<p>These bikes have traveled far with us. We crossed oceans with them aboard our boat, and did not regret bringing them along. We experimented with various ways to stow them, but the best way was to take both wheels off, to remove the pedals, turn the handle bars sideways, and to tie all components with straps. Then, we put them in bike bags, and stored them in our quarter berth.</p>

<p>The bags are nothing special, but allowed us to carry them with us aboard trains while in Japan.</p>

<h2 id='winter_insulation'><a href='winter_insulation.html'>winter insulation</a></h2><p>Living aboard in areas with hard winters is tricky, especially if your boat is not insulated. Condensation in lockers can damage wood, and cause rot and mold. A boat that isn't insulated will also cost more to heat. To keep the interior dry, it's necessary to get rid of the moisture generated by cooking and breathing. To dry the space out you need to allow air from outside into the cabin, and then heat it. The heat won't stay if your boat isn't insulated, but winter isn't the time to add insulation, it's better to wait for a drier, warmer season. If you try to use adhesives in cold weather, materials won't bond to the hull.</p>

<p>When we cook, we crack open a hatch to allow the steam to escape. We don't have room for a fan so this is our best option.</p>

<p><b>Hull</b>. As stated above, a good winter setup requires both insulation and ventilation in the cabin. Insulation keeps the inside of the boat warm when it is cold out, and ventilation helps to eliminate condensation. Condensation forms because of the difference in temperature and the ambient humidity. There is no miracle solution to eliminating condensation, the only thing to do is to keep the air flowing. Add vents to every locker, every space. If the air moves, moisture won't be an issue.</p>

<p>If you spend a lot of time in very, very cold weather, you will probably want to insulate thicker than 1” to get more R-value.</p>

<p><b>Closed-cell spray foam</b>. R-value per inch of R-7. A good way to insulate a hull is polyurethane closed-cell spray foam. Closed-cell foams tend to be water-resistant due to the closed nature of the cells that make up the foam. The more small and compact these cells are, the more resistant to water the material will be. This is how people insulate narrowboats. Closed cell foam is designed to expand to about 1″ of thickness when sprayed. The closed cell also acts as a vapor barrier, so water and moisture won't come through. While insulating, it also provides extra wall strength and buoyancy. The foam is sprayed directly onto the inside of the hull and adheres well to most surfaces. The foam can be trimmed, and sanded. Any foam that is cut loose its waterproof properties, and ought to be sealed. Generally, the foam is covered up with panelling for a nicer, cleaner finish.</p>

<p><b>Polyisocyanurate foam board</b>. Polyiso has a R-value per inch of R-6. Sold as rigid sheets, these are bonded to the bare hull using a strong adhesive, or spray foam (helps to close gaps). Insulation of this type must be sealed, and well-secured to the backing surface with no air gaps.</p>

<p><b>Extruded Polystyrene (XPS) Foam Board</b>. A rigid foam board with a R-value of R-5. They are typically blue, or pink(Foamular). Like polyiso, it doesn't retain water but performs better in cold weather. XPS is more bendable than polyiso if you have really curvy walls. XPS manufacturers use HFCs, making this not the greenest option. (This is what we chose, due to availability/price/r value.)</p>

<p>Note: EPS is not the same material as XPS, avoid this if you can, the air gaps make it weak to water.</p>

<p>For other types, see <a href='insulation.html' class='local'>insulation</a>.</p>

<p><b>Bilge and floor</b>. For the bilge area, keep it dry and cover the floors with carpet as insulation.</p>

<p><b>Windows</b>: The windows on our boat are another source of heat sink. We made <a href='curtains.html' class='local'>curtains</a> for each window, and plan to add a thin layer of bubble wrap in between it and the window in winter.</p>

<p><b>Ceilings</b>: If you can remove panels on your ceiling, install polyiso or XPS foam boards. Like the hull, these panels ought to be glued using spray foam or a high strength spray adhesive. Fill any gaps with spray foam.</p>

<p>Is there such a thing as <b>green</b> winter insulation? The greenest option is no insulation(ha!). Wool batting is green, yes, but tricky if you espouse non-speciest values. As <i>they</i> say, pick your poison.</p>
