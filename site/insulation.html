<h1>insulation</h1><p>15-07-21<br>North Saanich BC, Canada.</p>

<p>We have largely avoided winter these past 5 years, having instead chosen to follow summer around the Pacific. This was a good plan, we think. But we have since returned to Canada, a place not known for its tropical weather.</p>

<p>In the winter of 2020-2021, we woke up one morning with 4 feet of snow on deck. "Ah," we thought, "it snows here too." We cannot tell you why we thought there couldn't be snow here. We stayed in Victoria, the southernmost place in British Columbia, but apparently not south enough. Armed with electric heaters we kept Pino warm, but certain areas of the boat suffered because of condensation. While in <a href='new_zealand.html' class='local'>new zealand</a> we insulated the v-berth, badly. Shoddy, shoddy work. Our walls resembled a mountain face in Nuku Hiva after a big rain.</p>

<p>This year we are determined not to have a repeat of the winter of 2020-2021.</p>

<p>We installed a <a href='woodstove.html' class='local'>woodstove</a> in the main saloon. Wood stoves give off good, dry heat which should help keep the boat warm when we are off-grid. We also made <a href='curtains.html' class='local'>curtains</a> for our windows. Pino's windows are very large, and a significant source of heat loss. Next on our list is insulating important, and accessible parts of the boat.</p>

<p>Insulating a boat while it still has walls, floors and ceilings is an impossible job. We are not aiming for perfect, because perfect involves tearing the boat to pieces, but we will do our best to deal with exposed surfaces. In all though, the very best way to avoid condensation is <b>ventilation</b>.</p>

<img src='../media/content/insulation/03.jpg' title='cleaning glue off with acetone' loading='lazy'>

<p>We tore the old insulation off, and found that some came away with little mess or effort—a bad sign that our first installation was indeed shoddy. We scraped off the glue, and cleaned the rest off with acetone.</p>

<p>Then, we epoxied a series of wooded strips to create a scaffolding along the hull. We found this wood in the workshop of the local sailing club. People leave scrap wood from projects, good wood, and now it is ours. We plan to paint the wood with a thin layer of epoxy, so that mold can't reach our precious material.</p>

<p>Our boat has an existing bulge in the center of the wall, running from bow to stern. We removed the trim that was there previously, and plan to re-use it after adding the new upholstery.</p>

<img src='../media/content/insulation/01.jpg' title='wooden scaffolding along the hull, and a view of the bad bad resin' loading='lazy'>

<p>For this project we alternated between fancy, and so-so resin. One dried quickly, the other slowly, and its smell lingered in the cabin for days and days. West Systems resin is not cheap, but it is very good, and we regret trying the cheaper variety.</p>

<p>Next, came time to chose our insulation material. We chose Foamular, or XPS(extruded polystyrene). XPS is easy to find locally. It has a R-value of 5 per 1/2 inch, and it outperforms most other types of insulation, like Polyiso. Unlike Polyiso, XPS is less stiff and can follow curves better (depending on chosen thickness). The only thickness available to us was 1", thicker than we wanted, but we think we can make it work. It might shrink the v-berth a bit, but we don't think this borthersome. Warmth is preferable to width(ha). We'll likely layer a thin material overtop, so the wall won't be thicker than this.</p>

<h3>What else is there?</h3>

<ul>
	<li><b>Polyiso</b>. $$$. Rigid. Waterproof. Good R-value/inch.</li>
	<li><b>Spray Polyurethane Foam</b>. $$$$. High R-value/inch. Easy to apply. Doubles as floatation.</li>
	<li><b>Wool batts</b>. $$. Renewable. Biodegradable. Doesn't rot. Not cruelty-free. Low R-value/inch.</li>
	<li><b>Rockwool batts</b>. $$$$. Lower R-value/inch. Toxic.</li>
	<li><b>Fibreglass batts</b>. $. Fairly low R-value/inch. Not waterproof. Toxic.</li>
	<li><b>Denim batts</b>. $$$. Fairly low R-value/inch. Not waterproof. Non toxic.</li>
	<li><b>Cork</b>. $$$. Good R-value. Biodegradable. Waterproof. Insect proof. Sustainable.</li>
	<li><b>EPS</b>. $. Don't use this, absorbs too much water because of its looser cell structure.</li>
	<li><b>Thinsulate</b>. $$$$ Very low R-value/inch. Waterproof. Easy to install. Non-toxic.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>What about Reflectix?</b> Reflectix is a reflective insulation which functions best in specific situations. If you do not provide air space, Reflectix has less insulating value. It is useful to insulate areas that are impractical to insulate using other means, say due to lack of space, like around pipes or restricted areas. The product reflects heat back, rather than mass insulation such as the material examples stated above. On a boat, it might be useful to insulate a mast, or outside windows to reflect heat. **Don't place reflectix inside windows, as it can reflect heat back too well and can warp the windows.</p>

<h3>The work</h3>

<p>We measured each section we would have to cover with the foam boards, marked them up and cut shallow lines across its length and snapped off the pieces right off. We tried cutting them with a bench saw, for fun, but it is too fast and melts the foam.</p>

<img src='../media/content/insulation/02.jpg' title='dry fit of foamular boards' loading='lazy'>

<p>Next step, is to affix them to the wall. We bought some polyurethane adhesive (formula for foam boards), applied it to the back of the board and pressed it on firmly. We used mechanical support to press the board onto the wall while drying.</p>

<p>More soon...</p>
