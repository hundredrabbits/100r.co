  TEXT : Celebrated our crossing into Mexico with a japanese beer, figures. Tried to anchor at Todos Santos islands at night, but the anchorage was full of fish pens and large moorings. We left, and anchored somewhere we weren't supposed to in the Ensenada Harbour. Woke up to police calling out to us at 5am, telling us that we were sitting where the cruiseships come when they let off passengers. Found out you couldn't anchor anywhere in Ensenada anymore, so we went to Baja Naval... can't say we've been to a marina with such swell before. Had to make sacrificial lines to spare our docking lines from chafe.
