Left the next day, tore our mainsail, but fixed it up again underway. Rounded the bottom of baja california to get into the sea of Cortez and met a wall of wind. Had to wait in San Jose Del Cabo for the weather to settle before we could motor our way up. Stopped at Playa Bonanza before making the run to La Paz.

Woke up to police calling out to us at 5am, telling us that we were sitting where the cruiseships come when they let off passengers. Found out you couldn't anchor anywhere in Ensenada anymore, so we went to Baja Naval... can't say we've been to a marina with such swell before. Had to make sacrificial lines to spare our docking lines from chafe.
