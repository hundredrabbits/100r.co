<q>People are fed by the food industry, which pays no attention to health, and are treated by the health industry, which pays no attention to food.</q>
<cite>Wendell Berry</cite>
<p>Our diet consists solely of plants (legumes, fruits, grains, seeds, vegetables etc). The content of our meals depends on the season and on our location. We look at the adaptation and adoption of local produce as an exercise in creativity. Most processed food will come thickly packaged, and so to limit our waste we tend to avoid them.</p>
<p>Below is a list of rules that we go by, when it comes to choosing what to eat:</p>
<ul class='nobull'>
    <li>1. <b>Eat varied foods.</b> Biodiversity in the diet means less monoculture in the fields.</li>
    <li>2. <b>Pay more.</b> If you can. Spend more for foods grown or raised less intensively and with more care.</li>
    <li>3. <b>Eat plants.</b> Especially leafy greens.</li>
	<li>4. <b>Cook, instead of eating out.</b> If you can, plant a garden.</li>
    <li>5. <b>Avoid processed foods.</b> They cost more, and aren't as nutritious.</li>
    <li>6. <b>Eat local seasonal ingredients.</b> Roots in the winter, greens in the summer.</li>
    <li>7. <b>Preserve, and ferment.</b> For health, to save money, but also to avoid waste and to enjoy foods out of season.</li>
    <li>8. <b>Waste nothing.</b> People spend a lot of time growing food and getting it onto your plate, and not everyone in the world gets to eat their fill, wasting food does them all a great disservice. To avoid waste:
        <ul>
            <li><i>+ When planning for the day's meals, go through your fridge and pantry and use up ingredients that are likely to go bad first.</i></li>
            <li><i>+ When shopping buy ingredients that you know how to cook with and that you are likely to use in more than a single recipe.</i></li>
            <li><i>+ If you cannot finish a meal, keep it as a leftover, if you eat out bring a container with you so you can bring the unfinished food back home.</i></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, food ought to be regarded primarily as source of nourishment and pleasure, don't aim for perfection.</p>
<p>We eat a plant-based diet for <a href='https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Should_we_go_vegan%3F' target='_blank' class='external'>health, ethical and environmental reasons</a>.</p>
<p>Appropriately planned plant-based diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.
