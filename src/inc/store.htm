<p><b>— Thank you! —</b></p>

<p>Getting any of these items is a direct way to {support} our work. We prioritize digital items because we do not have the carrying capacity for the storage of physical items.</p>

<p>Rek takes <a href='http://kokorobot.ca/site/commission.html' target='_blank'>art commissions</a>, and they sell <a href='https://kokorobot.ca/site/store.html' target='_blank'>original ink drawings</a>. </p>

<h3><a id="shipping">Shipping for stickers</a></h3>
<p><b>Buying stickers</b>. When buying a sticker sheet, select your shipping destination in the dropdown menu.</p>
<img src='../media/content/characters/orca.rockout.png' style='float:right;' class='medium' />
<p><b>Be patient</b>. For physical items(sticker sheets), kindly allow for some time for the letter to arrive. We are a small team, and we package and ship each letter ourselves. We are not always near a post office, or mailbox. All letters ship from Western Canada, and can take more than a month to arrive to select international destinations.</p>
<p><b>Do you offer tracking?</b> We do not provide tracking with sticker purchases because the associated costs for registered mail, we think, are too high. We prioritize low costs over fast delivery.</p>
<p><b>Check your delivery address</b>. When purchasing stickers, be sure to check the delivery address so that the letter can make its way to you. If the letter returns to us because of an address error, we will have to request additional postage to send it again(we took on that cost in the past, but it adds up).</p>

<h3><a id="books">Paperback books</a></h3>

<p>The paperback books we sell are printed on-demand by Lulu.com.</p>

<p>They work with printers all over the world, so that most copies are produced locally and travel relatively short distances. It can take 3 to 5 work days to print the book. Since the books are printed, packaged, and shipped by humans, mistakes may happen. If your book arrives in less-than-perfect condition, <a href='https://help.lulu.com/en/support/solutions/articles/64000255314-providing-digital-defect-images' target='_blank'>contact Lulu.com</a> with images of shipping damage or printing errors, and they will send you another copy.</p>
