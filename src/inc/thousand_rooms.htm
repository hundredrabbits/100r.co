<p><a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/thousand-rooms' target='_blank'>Thousand Rooms</a> is a picture e-book, following the behaviors of four characters in a room bound by a set of rules that is unknown to them.</p>

<p>We have written this book with the hopes of creating a sort of Borges for children, in which the reader follows a bat, a cat, an owl and a fox who try and make sense of the space. The book encourages the reader to try and understand the rules, and plan unsuggested avenues.</p>

<p>The book is available in <b>18 languages</b> (all are available for download or purchase), and can be used as a tool for study. The translations were done on a volunteer basis. If you'd like to contribute a translation, or to make corrections to any text, please contact us at <b>rabbits ౷ 100r · co</b>.</p>

<h2 id='production'>production</h2>

<p>Thousand Rooms was conceived while on passage from {Mexico} to {French Polynesia} in 2017, and was completed in Nuku Hiva and Rangiroa. We made the decision to make a book project rather than a game because of our power limitations (see {tools ecosystem}).</p>

<p>We don't mind if you print yourself a copy. It can be put together beautifully using a simple five hole pamphlet stitch, but please do not re-distribute or sell it.</p>
