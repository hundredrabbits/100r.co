<p>On the passage from <b>{Victoria}</b> to <b>{Sitka}</b> we traveled 1,800 NM, the journey lasting from May 1st to August 11th 2024. Rek kept a logbook of our travels, to help us remember the conditions we encountered, our thoughts at the time, etc. Sailing near shore, we think, is more difficult than sailing offshore, there are more obstacles to deal with, like traffic, reefs, currents, and land effects on wind.</p>
<p>Our aim was to get near 58°N, the highest we sailed on this trip was 57°N. We wanted to explore Southeast Alaska and the north coast of British Columbia, to experience anchoring in deeper waters, and to see if we could enjoy sailing in colder, rainier weather.</p>

    <td><b>{Victoria} to Sidney</b><hr><img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_photo_01.jpg'alt="view from the deck of a sailboat of a lighthouse with snowcapped mountains in the background" loading='lazy'></a>I awoke to an awful sound, an alarm ringing at 0540. Devine had been waking up at 0600 every second day all year to go to the gym, and so was used to this, but I could not find my feet. The morning was rude, I couldn't persuade my body to leave the bed to face it — it had taken us so long to build up this much warmth! I knew that current waits for no one, and so with eyes still closed, my legs crawled out of the blankets, my body inevitably followed, ragdolling out of bed and into the cold.<br>We got dressed, to preserve what little warmth we had left, then made sure that everything aboard was secured for our sail to Sidney. We're always forgetful when we haven't sailed in a while. In the winter, the boat is still, so still that it becomes part of the land. {Pino} sways at the dock in heavy winds, but nothing threatens to fall over, the motion is never violent. Now, each item must go back to its assigned spot, lashed down.<br>There is light outside at this hour, it helps, but waking before the birds is not right. As soon as we moved outside, Peter, our dock neighbor and good friend, was there to greet us. Peter, like myself, doesn't share Devine's early hour waking habit, but he knew we were leaving, and made an effort to be there to say goodbye. Even at this early morning hour, Peter looked as dapper as ever, Peter, who goes to the gym in corduroy pants and button down shirts. We hug, he helps us push off.</td>

    <td>Pino glided away from the dock on calm waters, propelled by Calcifer II. Our departure awoke another neighbor, Gunther, he was outside, and he too waved us off, "where are you going again?" he asked. "Alaska!" we whisper-shouted back as we drifted past — it was early, we didn't want to make more noise than necessary. The little ephemeral floating community we'd found was precious, like birds returning to land to nest every year, we all gather in the fall, and come spring, everyone flies away. Some birds return to the nest, others don't, drawn by the allure of distant lands.<br> A light breeze greeted us at the mouth of the outer Victoria Harbour, we hoisted Pino's wings inside the calm of the breakwater. When out in the Juan de Fuca Strait, the body of water that we must cross to get to Sidney, the wind was not strong enough to push us by itself. Calcifer II continued to provide help.</td>

<tr>  
    <td>Last winter, we built our own {gimballed stove}, we tried it for the first time underway. I toasted bread in our heavy cast iron pan, then coated one side of the crunched-up exterior with peanut butter. While we ate our breakfast, I boiled water to thin the moka pot coffee — doing this fools us into thinking there is more coffee to drink. I passed the grinder to Devine outside who was steering and holding the tiller with one leg. We had modified our tiller head for this trip, it was now low enough that we could steer like this, freeing our hands for other tasks. We bought this wooden tiller at a scrapyard in Sonoma(California) in 2016, when sailing down the west coast of the United States. The head, which binds the tiller to the rudder stock, forced it at an angle that was abnormally high for steering, but the tiller itself was perfect. We rectified the design this year, but only because a crack had formed in the head which forced us to put together a makeshift replacement, consisting of an aluminum pipe, several heavy bolts and bungees. When the water in the kettle was hot, I switched it for the moka pot and completed our breakfast routine. The boat wasn't heeling enough for this to be a good first test for our stove, but the unit performed well.</td>

    <td>Victoria is on the south end of a peninsula to the southeast of Vancouver Island, Sidney is on the northeastern end of this same peninsula, 25 NM away. When we turned around the south end of the peninsula, the wind left us, as it tends to do in this area. The wind only ever bends around the corner when Juan de Fuca is in a bad mood. The calm lured out several small fishing boats. We laughed, seeing the number of gulls at their heels. Each boat had its own little gull fan club. Some gulls were resting on the cabin tops, the rest were in the water, paddling around, waiting for scraps or for space to free up on the boat. We wondered if the people on those boats liked the gulls. Were they friends? Did they give them names? Or were they a terrible nuisance?</td>

    <td><b>Sidney to Montague</b><hr><img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_photo_02.jpg' alt="view from the deck of a sailboat, at sail, with a ferry crossing the bow of the vessel" loading='lazy'></a>The alarm rang at 0600, we snoozed until 0640, then left at 0800 to catch the current north to our next anchorage. Bing, bang, boom. After pushing off the dock, we pulled onto another to fill 4x20 L bins with diesel — our main fuel tank only holds 62 L, keeping annexes aboard is necessary for long coastal trips. We hoped the wind would be a frequent companion on our trek north.</td>
</tr>
<tr>  
    <td>The wind was blowing out of the northeast, but we only felt it once past Portland Island. It was coming out of where we needed to go, but as strange as it sounds to those unacquainted with the physics of sailing, a sailboat can work with this. We tightened the sheets and sailed into the wind, tacking as required. Devine read through a thick book documenting Southeast Alaska anchorages, while I, at the tiller, counted cormorants in the water. We saw a group of 30 near Portland Island, with a few gulls amongst them. The gulls were outnumbered, out of place, surrounded by cormorant heads — both were easy to distinguish from afar, because cormorants sink, while gulls float.<img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_02.jpg' alt="a gull afloat on the water surrounded by cormorants, only their heads showing" loading='lazy'>We played dodge-the-ferries, while tacking northward, until the breeze became too weak to sail with. Calcifer II carried us the rest of the way to Montague Harbour. We arrived at 1300. Tacking had added 3 extra nautical miles to our trip. Sailing into the wind is not the quickest way forward, we can't be in a hurry, but timing matters when sailing in waters governed by strong currents. The current reverses many times per day, when it turns against us, progress is slow, and depending on the strength of the current it can stop our vessel outright. If the wind isn't with us, with a current running, progress is a beautiful dream. Our motor can carry us through <i>some</i> current, but it feels like throwing money into the ocean. In these waters, seeing sailboats motor into the wind, constrained by a short tidal exchange, is common.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>We arrived in Montague Harbour, a large anchorage on Galiano Island that can host hundreds of boats, dropping our anchor in 11 m(35 ft). The bay hosts several local boats on moorings, but was otherwise empty. Despite there being large areas free of anchored boats, a large motor boat came into the anchorage, 20 minutes after we had arrived, and dropped their anchor very near ours. Pino is a shiny lure, drawing the attention of bigger fish.<img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_01.jpg' alt="a large motor vessel, drawn as a big cute blog of a creature, is throwing its anchor down close to pino, grinning all the while. Pino is not pleased." loading='lazy'>Inside the cabin, we picked up a few disobedient items that had rolled out of their berths. Some items had found the floor, "this isn't your room," I said, remembering the classic line said by Tom Hanks to a dog in Turner and Hooch — sometimes I fear that too many of my words are borrowed from films.<br>We prepared basmati rice with sauteed sweet potatoes, tofu, and greens, seasoned with soy sauce and mirin, with a side of miso soup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>That night, we continued reading The Martian by Andy Weir. In the book, Mark Whatney must be self-sufficient, he must ration his food to survive. With our upcoming trip, we don't have to ration, our time away from others won't span 4 years, but we do need to be cautious with both food and water. At sea, Pino must be an island.</td>

    <td><b>Montague</b><hr><br>The wind was too light to sail, so we waited in Montague for an extra day. Avi sent us a message, asking if we'd like to go see the Recycling Center's new plastic crusher and press. We rowed Teapot to shore and met Avi at the dinghy dock, he gave us a ride to the Recycling Center.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The new machines transformed plastic waste into new materials, which locals could use to produce art, for construction, or to make replacement parts at home. Same type plastics were gathered — polypropylene, polystyrene, etc. The shredder reduced the plastic into smaller pieces, and a separate machine, a heated hydraulic press, softened and merged the bits into a solid sheet. The size of the sheet depended on the amount of shredded plastic, and the sheet thickness(adjustable with the press). Mixing different colored plastics resulted in a gorgeous mandala daubed with bright and glaring patterns. Ading a single shredded bottle of yellow mustard created amazing contrast. The sheet of plastic ressembled a painting, born of plastic waste.<br>Previously, Galiano Island was exporting all of its plastic waste to the Vancouver mainland, a lot of it now stays on the island, given a second, and hopefully lasting purpose.<br>The recycling center was across from a building that accepts second hand goods, all from residents of Galiano. The center separates all recyclables so they are better processed — just like in Japan. The rest of British Columbia doesn't discern between different kinds of plastics, it also doesn't recycle glass... which is... insane.</td>

    <td><b>Montague to Secretary Islands</b><img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_photo_04.jpg' alt="a photo of a small opening between two islands, with somekind of industrial building way in the background, emitting smoke"  loading='lazy'></a>0830 departure from {Galiano} Island, with the goal of stopping either at a bight between the Secretary Islands, or at Clam Bay, a short 10 NM sail away. We needed an anchorage that offered protection from both the SE and NW — a difficult find in these waters, given the fact that most bays have either a SE or NW orientation. Montague fits that description, but it was too far south, we wanted to be near Porlier Pass to exit at slack current come morning. The Gulf Islands are surrounded by natural barriers, rapids that prudent sailors ought to take at slack tide, during the calm between the reversal of the current. All of the rapids open onto Georgia Strait, a large body of water that separates Vancouver Island from the mainland coast.<br>The Secretary Islands anchorage was on the way to Clam Bay, we had never been there, but we would go by to check it out, to see if it was suitable for an overnight stay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>We had 5-10 kn on our bow the entire way, but it lessened as we neared our destination. The small bight between the Secretary Islands was open to the north, and we suspected that northwest winds could creep in through Porlier Pass to disturb it, but we decided to chance it.<br>We set our anchor in 6 m (20 ft) of water, in mud. The stronger gusts were curling around the corner, entering the anchorage. The winds later rose to 15-20 kn, but would lessen before dying entirely. It was supposed to turn to the southeast overnight, and to build up come Sunday morning into a strong enough breeze to carry us across the strait. It was likely that we would have endured these same wind conditions in Clam Bay. Clam Bay, a bay tucked between two islands, is full of debris, old crab pots, disused aquaculture gear, it is not our favorite spot. The unnamed bight in the Secretary Islands was a welcome change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>At 1400, the forecast was upgraded to a strong wind warning, with 20-30 kn blowing in the strait — not a fun surprise. The anchorage became more rolly, with the boat yawing with the coming waves. We both felt sea sick. Like before, only the strong gusts penetrated our little bight, but the waves were sneaking around the corner, invading our space. Devine took a nap, working on the computer in these conditions was too difficult. I wanted to nap too, to rid myself of a headache, but I preferred to keep watch. <img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_04.jpg' alt="pino the sailboat at anchor, not enjoying the wind waves" loading='lazy'></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Later, the forecast changed yet again, down to 15-25 kn. The motion at anchor became tolerable, cooking dinner without fear of feeling sea sick would be possible. I cooked some sticky brown rice with a topping of sweet and sour chickpeas with crushed peanuts on top. The wind was howling in the strait, but it wasn't felt as strongly here. The wind left entirely at 1700, allowing us to sleep well. We are always grateful when the wind goes to sleep too.</td>

    <td><b>Secretary Islands to {Smuggler Cove}</b><hr><br>We awoke to an even quieter quiet. A lonely log drifted past, a bald eagle sat atop a bare tree top, a dog barked, the echo distorted the bark of the dog, making it appear like it belonged to a larger, more ferorious animal.<br>We left our unnamed nook at 0830, motoring towards Porlier Pass to catch it at its quietest. Porlier Pass can run fast at peak current, but like all rapids, when timed right, the waters are smooth. Today, the waters were undisturbed. We passed a log supporting 12 black-headed gulls, we named them: the black-headed gull syndicate. This log was <i>the</i> place to be, this is where shady decisions in the black-headed gull world happened.<img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_05.jpg' / loading='lazy'>A small fishing boat idled in the pass in the shallows, we glided past them, hoping to find a rippled sea in the strait. Ripples were indicative of wind. The forecast had been unreliable, what was supposed to be 10-15 kn out of the southeast, turned into wind that was supposed to die entirely at 1000, not long after our exit from Porlier Pass. Wind was forecast in the north part of Georgia Strait, so we thought we'd go out and find it. We spotted a band of darker water on the horizon, there <i>was</i> wind out there, but we had to push further away from the shore to reach it. We met with the rippled band of water, hoping that it would stay rippled, it did, with many more bands ahead.</td>

<tr>
    <td>Our plan was to skirt along the length of Galiano Island, if the wind did not manifest we would duck into Gabriola(another island, further north). The wind stayed, so we pushed on.<br>10-15 kn winds out of the southeast carried us all the way across. The wind did lessen at times, but it always increased again to fill our sails. The day started grey, and stayed grey. Our new rain jackets saw their first rain today. Our former foulweather gear would get wet and stay wet, making any sail in the rain uncomfortable, while our new vinyl bibs and jackets kept us dry. Although, keeping our hands dry and warm at the same time was a problem.</td>

<tr> 
    <td>It was difficult to see the Vancouver mainland with this rain. In the absense of a visual reference, we had to follow our compass. We took turns steering Pino. When we spend long days on the water we have to give the other time to rest, to warm up. Most Alaska-bound sailors favor boats with enclosed cockpits, but Pino's cockpit is always exposed to the weather. The rain, the sun, and the wind always find us. Both of us were dry today, but it was cold, we hadn't layered on enough clothes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>When we arrived at the entrance to Smuggler's Cove it was 1600, both of us were spent, our defenses eroded by the prolonged exposure to the rain and cold. In such conditions, our bodies have to work extra harder to keep us warm, burning more energy. "My tank is low." Just as I'd said this, the rain increased, bringing the morale onboard to a newfound low. We dropped the hook in the middle basin, not bothering to stern-tie to shore.<br>Devine fired up the woodstove while I secured gear in the cockpit and on deck, determined not to have to go back out there once I tasted the warmth of the cabin. We ate a hearty rice noodle soup, it warmed our insides, while the woodstove took care of our outer shells. Our plan for tomorrow was to go to the grocery store in Pender Harbour. In our haste to leave Victoria, we forgot to stock up on a few key ingredients, like olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. The grocery store there, we knew, had excellent baguettes in stock.<br>A singlehanded sailor came into the anchorage at 1900, he decided to stern-tie, even if there was room, even if it was raining buckets.<img src="../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_06.jpg" alt="a drawing of smugglers cove, showing some boats at anchor, as well as islets and shoals" loading="lazy"></td>

    <td><b>Smuggler's Cove to Pender Harbour</b><hr><br>The wind kept us awake last night. Southeast winds funnel through Smuggler's Cove. Our swing radius was very limited in this bay, when the anchor rode was taut, we were 18 m (60 ft) away from the shore. We assumed a southeast wind would point us toward the outer basin. Swinging that close to shore doesn't ever stop being worrisome. We were awake from 0100 to 0400. After 0400, the wind lessened, our anchor watch was over, we fell asleep.</td>

<tr>
    <td>We woke up at 0700. We've experienced big weather while anchored in this bay before, but whenever a detail changes, like anchoring somewhere new in the same bay, it is difficult to have complete trust. Our boat is infinitely valuable to us, sleeping badly is a small price to pay, and we can catch up on sleep later.<br>We could see our own breath because of the cold. We prepared whole wheat pancakes for breakfast, while firing up the woodstove.</td>

    <td>We left Smuggler's Cove at 0930, riding the tide north to Pender Harbour, a short 10 NM hop away. The sun came out during our transit, warming our bodies, a reminder that the world could be warm, that it could have color in it. Some clouds drew shapes on Texada Island, while others, heavy with water, threatened to burst. We spied a large cloud with a skirt of rain, south of us, the wind was helping it along, it too had Pender Harbour in sight. We hoped to arrive before it reached us.</td>

We always leave with backup anchorages in mind, some for if the wind is helpful, others for if it isn't.<br>We forgot to buy a small axe while in Victoria, we considered looking for one in Pender Harbour but there were no hardware stores within reasonable walking distance — much of British Columbia is car-centric. We hope to find one in Port McNeill, a city near the top of Vancouver Island. We would use the axe to split our own kindling for the woodstove, wood sold in stores is usually not sized for our little 23x23 cm firebox. Mornings are still very cold aboard Pino, we run the woodstove to stay comfortable.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
    <td>We left the dock at 1000. The wind funneled into the Harbour, a sign that there was a lot of weather out there. We put a reef in, beating to weather under a full sail can get really sporty. We inched out of the Harbour by motor, and sailed as soon as we cleared the outermost island and begun a seemingly infinite succession of tacking, with one coast fading away while the other came into focus. On each tack, our eyes found a landmark to aim for across the channel. Every lighthouse, old cannery, cliff face or clear-cut area on a mountain, acted a a marker and a proof of our progress.<br>We had to tack 6 times to line up with the entrance to Ballet Bay, our planned anchorage of the day.</td>

    <td>We saw two other sailboats on the water today. One of them, a catamaran, beat us to our anchorage, while the other sailed on. At times, we were going at 6 kn, a fine speed under a reefed mainsail. The boat was heeling to 20 degrees, a good test for our gimballed stove. We have used it everyday since we left.</td>

<tr>
    <td>Once we arrived into Ballet Bay, we saw that the catamaran had claimed the shallows, but we found a spot nearby in 13 m (45 ft, 16 m / 55 ft at HW). The northwest wind found its way into the bay, but there were no waves at least.<br>We prepared sandwiches with a baguette we picked up in Pender Harbour. I was glad to have waited to arrive to eat, some meals are unpleasant to eat underway. When the wind and the waves are up, I feel like I have to finish the meal in a hurry, I don't get to enjoy it. I want to enjoy my sandwich. I <i>will</i> enjoy my sandwich!</td>

In 13 m (45 ft) of water, all of the chain rode is out (we have 30 m / 100 ft of chain aboard), with a good length of rope rode hanging in the deeps. Pino does not have a windlass aboard, we haul everything up by hand, or by using a chain hook and leading a line back to a cockpit winch. The chain stopper at the bow locks the chain, permitting us to adjust the chain hook safely. We can't use the same technique for the rope rode, though. Up until now, we did it by hand, but that won't be possible in depths greater than 18 m (60 ft), which we'll likely encounter up north. Our plan was to tie a prusik knot around the rope rode to haul it in (read more about it in {no windlass}).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>This is not the fastest, or easiest method of hauling an anchor rode, but it works. Today, the wind was light, the water not too deep, we hoped it would continue to work well in more difficult conditions. Winches provide excellent mechanical advantage. A determined sailor could lift an anchor by way of a 4:1 pulley system alone, a technique <a href="https://roperescuetraining.com/index.php" target="_blank">rescuers</a> use, but winches are present on most boats our size. Motor boats too could benefit from having a winch onboard, especially in the event of a windlass failure, or to pull in a stern line in heavy winds. We've seen boats failing to secure their stern lines with wind on the beam because they lacked the strength to pull the line in by hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>After hauling all of the rode back on deck, we motored out of Ballet Bay to a calm Malaspina Strait. The forecast called for 5-15 kn out of the northwest. Sometimes this means 5, other times 15, but it is usually zero. I spied a dark blue band on the water ahead. "Either that's wind, or a tide line," I said, grabbing the binoculars, "Wind! Lots of it!" We raised Pino's wings, entered the blue band, and sailed, sailed, sailed! Then, shortly after, we reefed, reefed, reefed, because the wind was stronger than 15 kn(we cannot offer precise readings, because our wind meter died a long time ago). As we reefed the main, we accidentally heaved-to, which sent a few loose items rolling in the cabin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>We zigzagged up Malaspina Strait. The wind lessened as we neared Sturt Bay on the northeast end of Texada Island. While moorage on this coast keeps increasing, the dock fees for the modest facilities at the Texada Boating Club continue to be reasonable, but we decided to try anchoring in the bay north of the docks for the first time instead. We later learned that the bottom was fouled with old logging gear. Texada Island's industry, consisting of both logging and mining, has mostly disappeared, but scars remain. Many bays on this coast are fouled with old machinery, we often see rusty cables and gear on land when hiking, posing as roots, half-buried in the soil and ferns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>We had Japanese curry for dinner, using up two whole potatoes that had begun to sprout. These days, we move everytime there is wind, even if it's weak. In the summer, a forecast of 5-15 kn will often mean no wind, but if the same numbers are forecast in the spring, the higher number is often more accurate. So far, we have sailed almost everyday. This was very different from the kind of sailing we'd done in these waters these past 4 years. We usually enjoy staying in the same anchorage for days, or weeks at a time. We will have to slow down once we arrive near open waters, stronger weather may not allow us to sail everyday — I am getting ahead of myself, eyes on tomorrow, Rek, eyes on tomorrow... well, eyes on tonight! I look forward to continuing to read The Martian. Mark Whatney is sprouting potatoes, just like us!</td>

The jackets each had 2 stoppers on the bottom, but we never used them. The only thing that these stoppers were good for was for getting caught in the cabin table when walking inside. Our table has an extension — bound to the main part of the table by a piano hinge — that we fold down when underway. The stopper on my jacket liked to get caught in the hinge between the two halves.

After engaging the chain stopper, I had to walk back to the block, which was as far as the chain hook could go on deck, I then unhooked the chain to drag it back, mud and all, into the locker at the bow.

The weather in that strait did not inspire an early visit, it was still blowing 35 kn, we instead chose to take the back route, via the {Yuculta and Dent Rapids}. We planned to cross the rapids on the 12th of May, until then we had time to waste. Why the 12th? Because the turn to ebb was at a reasonable hour on a neap tide. Neap tides are the lowest tides of the lunar month, occurring in the second and fourth quarters of the moon. At this point in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is at its minimum, making it an ideal time to traverse through fast-flowing rapids. A small tide reduces the speed of the current.</td>

The fender squeaked and shifted uncomfortably as I tied the other end of the trip line onto it, as if to say, "you have <i>got</i> to be kidding!" The fender recalled the time we used it and 2 others of its kin to buoy our anchor chain while in French Polynesia. The 3 fenders were submerged, hovering in the depths, preventing the chain from getting caught in coral on the ocean floor.

Once we arrived at Gillard Passage, we had more current to power through, especially at the narrowest point, but it was less than 1 kn. We arrived at Dent Rapids later than we had planned(15-20 minutes later), but we didn't have any trouble. On anything but a neap tide, arriving late would have been costly.

We knew we couldn't carry enough wood to keep the stove running constantly, but it was useful to warm our space on cold mornings and late evenings. We filled Pino's aft locker with wood, storing the rest in bags in the starboard side cockpit locker.<br>We finished splitting the wood just as the rain started. The rain revealed a leak on one of the starboard side chainplates. When the deck dries out, we will fix the leak.</td>

To make matters worse, Cape Caution was preceeded by another danger: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slingsby_Channel" target="_blank">Nakwakto Rapids</a> — one of the fastest and most turbulent rapids in the world. When the channel is at peak ebb with an opposing wind, the contact between the two will generate very large waves in the north part of the strait.

The rain had stopped for a while, but came back as we began to motor down Racey Inlet, the wetness stayed with us for the entire way, except now, we had it in the face rather then in the back. Downwind, the rain hit our backs and wasn't bothersome, but now, it was soaking Devine's front. "UGH!" I ugh'ed back in agreement.<br>The rain fell very hard at times. I was partially hidden behind our mini dodger, navigating from there, my spot was a haven in comparison to Devine's exposed location. I offered to take turns.<br>To make matters worse, there as a bit of current against us in the inlet, slowing our progress, prolonging our time in the rain. The time to our destination felt like it stayed at 52 minutes for 3 hours, in reality, it took us a bit over an hour to arrive, but it felt like more in those conditions. When we create waypoints on our chartplotter, we can see the time left to our destination based on our current speed. It is sometimes reassuring to see the time we have left, but today, it was driving us mad.</td>

We passed a crab trap float, and could see the pull the water had on it, this is what we were up against. Even at anchor, the current kept our rope rode taut.</td>

We bought some minutes for our SAT phone for such times, but we weren't going to get a signal out here, in a place tucked between tall mountains. I tried anyway, but noticed that the app that we use to visualize GRIB files was uninstalled on our little ipad — how did this happen? We didn't do this. We learned that Apple thinks its doing us a favor by uninstalling apps — without our consent — that we haven't used in a while, to save on storage space. I really do not like technology making decisions for me. We will only have internet access in Prince Rupert to re-install this app. Fuck you Apple, for removing apps without asking...

The squall clouds were enormous, they spewed out tropical-style amounts of rain while accelerating the wind in the area. One particular squall scared me. The wind whistled in the rigging as it approached us from the stern. Lacking a wind meter, we cannot know the exact wind speed, but we could tell it was strong by listening. The following waves were impressive, pushing at our rear, the sky was dark too, making the scene all the more ominous.<br>I had an anxiety attack, maybe it was fatigue, but more likely it was the fear of big waves. Ever since one threw me overboard I felt nervous when a high wave approached our boat. If it sounded big but wasn't, it still had the power to frighten me. I wasn't sure if this fear would persist, we hadn't seen proper ocean swells since the summer of 2020. I might not have reacted this way if I had been tethered to the boat, I wasn't. The tether was what kept me attached the boat that last time. I should have had it on me already. Anyhow, Devine, kind and sweet and infinitely supportive, rushed out to steer as the squall passed. It gave me time to compose myself, the fear was still there, but the shock subsided. Devine endured another squall later for me. Solid gold Devine.</td>

The narrowest part of the inlet had no wind, so we doused it there.<br>My hands were frozen when we arrived near the anchorage, they were red and sensitive. Reaching under the folded mainsail to secure it with a sail tie hurt like hell. I slipped my anchoring gloves on, gloves that were torn, salty, cold, wet and reeking of various sea things. I really need to replace these gloves. I was fine using them in the Salish Sea, but it was struggle in colder waters, as was heaving chain hand-over-hand.

Here, the tides were 6 m (20 ft), something we had to consider when choosing a spot. Like all places on this coast, Patterson Inlet was quiet, green and surrounded by mountains and wildlife. We always heard the sound of rushing water, from a fast-flowing river, or waterfall nearby.<br>But as always, the cold and wetness had worn us out. In Quebec, we say "avoir les deux yeux dans l'même trou," to say that we are very tired, it translates to "having two eyes in the same hole." That was the best way to describe how we felt when we arrived.</td>

We hoisted the dinghy back on deck, as we did this the wind began to increase, putting us stern to shore. The head of the inlet was very narrow, and with 33 m (110 ft_ of rope rode out, Pino was swinging far, very near the shore. We had anchored here because we thought the wind was going to stay in the south, it hadn't. Our anchor was set well, but we were concerned that the weather would increase.<br>We began lifting the anchor, with plans to leave this accursed bay, but our fears were realized because the weather did increase. Retrieving a 15 kg (33 lbs) anchor along with 30 m (100 ft) of chain and 30 m (100 ft) of rope rode, was not easy in conditions like this. Devine had difficulty keeping Pino pointing into the wind, making it harder for me to hoist in the rode. Devine motored ahead to try and ease the tension on the line, but then the line was pointing straight back, we couldn't understand why, and I couldn't do anything. Devine had stopped going forward but the rode was still running along the side of the boat, pointing backwards. After a few moments of hectic experimentation, the line was freed and Pino was swinging at the end of the rode again. Oof.<br>Devine continued to motor forward, only giving little pushes at a time, permitting me to hoist in the rope rode. But when there was about 6 m (20 ft) of rope left to hoist, I had to stop.

I used the technique described in detail in {no windlass} to pull up most of the rode.

Ah, Southeast Alaskan ports, with oil disposal facilities near every exit, but disposal of cans requires walking for 20 minutes, finding the hidden bin near the grocery store at the far end of the parking lot(had there been any cars, it would have been impossible to see it) — really though, I was glad that oil was disposed of responsibly, not providing those collection sites would result in careless acts.<br>The city was well-equipped for getting repairs done, there was a boatyard, plenty of hardware stores, fabrication shops, etc. Speaking of fabrication, while in a public restroom, Devine & I both fixated on the design of the toilet paper roll holder. The design was simple, strong, and effective. In most public restrooms, the holders are made of cheap plastic, we loved that they had fabricated their own. If someone were to ask us what we think about Wrangell... "LOVE their toilet paper roll holders!"</td>

One eagle tried to land on the masthead of a sailboat, we cringed a little when we saw its talons bite at the instruments mounted there, trying to find a comfortable foothold. In the end, it grew tired of trying and found a spot on a fishing boat rig. We've had plenty of time lately to observe eagles from up close, they're such beautiful birds, although they seem to rely on local fishermen a lot for food.</td>

    <td>A lot of tug boats towing large barges, commercial fishing boats and large passenger ships(like the Alaska ferry) use Wrangell Narrows. Some parts of the narrows were very constricted, and if a large ship was coming through we would have to get out of its way. The goal of the game was to constantly look behind, or ahead, and if a big vessel was coming, it was time to find a place to duck out of the channel to let them by. As soon as we left the anchorage, we saw a tug boat on AIS, a big one, pulling a very big load. We kept an eye on it as we proceeded through the narrows. It caught up to us near Green Rocks, we moved out of the channel and into the bight just east of Christmas Tree Rock to let it pass. We knew that this area was ahead, it wasn't too shallow, it had few rocks, a very good place to idle. It was powering north at 10 kts, pulling a heavy barge carrying containers, and construction vehicles. The tug pulling it was gargantuan.<img src="../media/content/travel/petersburg_02.jpg"><br>We encountered many more boats in Wrangell Narrows, mostly small run-abouts, or medium-sized cruising or fishing boats.

    <td>Like Blake Channel, this was the kind of channel where the current meets from the north and south between channel markers 44 and 50(what we refer to as the pinch, one of the narrowest points). To not have to suffer an opposing current, it was a good idea to time the northbound transit on the last of a flood. As the flood(south current) lessens to zero, if the boat is positioned where the north and south currents meet, the north current will start to ebb and carry us north. We knew we had to get to the pinch at 0940, we arrived at 0930. When you know your boat well, timing arrivals with precision is not too difficult, we always give ourselves a bit of extra time to make speed adjustments... because there is always something that happens that slows us down(like letting that tug pass).</td>

Slips in this harbor were not expensive.<br>Like in Ketchikan, transient boats were assigned to slips that the owners had temporarily vacated. The harbormaster assigned us a spot on the south side of the south finger in North Harbor. We were glad that they had assigned us to the north docks, that way we were closer to the harbour master's office, where the showers are. We were dying for a hot shower, our last one was in Prince Rupert. Because we arrived at the start of a rising flood, some current ran through the channel leading to the docks, and affected our steering. We could feel a slight current pushing us sideways as we went down the row of docks, but it wasn't strong enough, not yet, on large tidal exchanges it would likely be very difficult to get to a slip.</td>

Once at 60 m (200 ft) of rode, paying it out was difficult, the rope rode was too light and didn't want to leave the boat. It kept twisting, laying limp in the water. Paying out the chain was easier because of its weight, rope rode was ok too usually, but when the required length exceeded 53 m (175 ft), I had to force it off the boat.

We were battleworn, tape was our last ditch effort to secure our fort against these fiends. "I don't know how we're going to raise the anchor in the morning tomorrow," I said, exasperated, "if their numbers hold..."<br>We usually had 10-20 to contend with at once, but tonight the air outside was thick with them. Fly-induced nighttime. We didn't usually have to contend with such enormous swarms. Keeping mosquitoes and horseflies out was never an issue, but these things could walk through tiny cracks. In the end, our desperate, but aggressive fortifications were sufficient, the insect world and Pino's cabin were separate again. We scraped many tiny bodies off the walls, and went to bed.</td>

 <td><b>Eva Islands to Baby Bear Bay</b><hr>The world outside the cabin was calm, too calm. Where were our assailants? We could see a few lone soldiers fluttering outside. I needed to go out to transfer 20 L of diesel into our tank, but seeing the reduced swarm gave me courage. I ventured outside, but when I entered the cockpit I saw that it was completely littered with tiny bodies, the entire army had perished overnight. The corpses were concentrated around the sliding boards, near the crack in our companionway door screen that had briefly served as a biting midge highway yesterday(before we taped it up). Pino's deck was speckled with them. Some survivors took to the air, ready for another round, I did my best to drive them off. I had covered most of my skin, I had a tuque drawn down over the top half of my face down to my eyes, gloves... everything. My hands were occupied with the diesel transferring process, and so I fended off my attackers by blowing air at them.<br>The refill operation was a success, although they kept landing on my head and shoulders, away from my mouth... clever fuckers. I kept shaking my head and shoulders to get them to leave. From afar, I must have looked like I was possessed, bothered by unseen things. When finished, I ran for shelter inside the cabin, but the battle would continue because we had to raise the anchor...</td>
</tr>
 <td>I am happy to report that we were able to raise the anchor, largely unbothered, by then the amount of tiny flies was tolerable. Although Devine woke up with some kind of indigestion, they weren't feeling well, so I steered Pino, with plans to continue to steer all the way to our next anchorage should their condition not improve. Devine slept in the cockpit while I got us through the eastern half of Peril Strait. For now, I was aiming towards Appleton Cove, a short 12 NM ride away. Going far didn't make sense if my sailing partner was ill. Luckily, the nap cleared whatever was ailing Devine, and they decided that they felt ok enough to go all the way to Baby Bear Bay, 29.9 NM away. We thought the current would help us get there faster, but it did not add to our speed.<br>A cruise ship, 4 power boats, and a fishing boat all went passed us. Once near Nismeni Cove, a humpback whale surfaced at our bow, and so we put the engine in idle. It swam by close, past our starboard side and around our stern. Whales swim with such ease, such elegance, our whale friend joined another of their kin further away.</td>

   <td>Once we entered the pass south of Otstoia Island, we saw 2 northbound sailboats: a metal ketch, and a race boat with a banana-colored deck flying the Holland flag. The wheel of the race boat was so large it spanned its entire width. The sailboats in this area tend to be rugged, custom built. We haven't seen a lot of production boats. Pino feels very commonplace in comparison.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Once past Povorotni Island, our speed increased dramatically to 6 knots. The water here was disturbed, with many back eddies swirling around us which would send Pino sliding one way, then the other. The current was very strong here, and stayed strong all the way to Baby Bear Bay. The most disturbed waters lay between Rapids Point and Yellow Point. It was intimidating to enter such waters, our speed neared 7.5 knots at times. We encountered a back eddie near the Middle Point red channel marker that slowed us down to 3.4 knots. This reversal stayed with us all the way to the entrance to Baby Bear Bay. Some motor boats that were ahead of us went to anchor in Deep Bay, place with room anchoring room for large boats.<br>The entrance to Baby Bear Bay was fringed with reefs and bull kelp, but the charts were correct and we managed well enough. It was near high tide when we arrived, with the current running at max ebb in Sergius Narrows. At first glance, it looked like no one else was anchored here, we aimed for the cosy nook in the northwest corner, but when we drew near it we saw that it was occupied by a small motor boat. We anchored further out in 12 m (40 ft, max high tide). It feels nice to anchor in shallower waters, for once. We arrived at 17h30, Devine lit a fire and prepared a pumpkin soup for dinner.</td>

  <td><b>Baby Bear Bay to Piper Island</b><hr>No tiny biting midges came to disturb our home today, but as usual, their compatriots, the horseflies, were around. It was at least easier to fend off larger targets.<br>A wind was blowing from the northwest, bringing clear skies. The motor boat left at 0830, while we stayed put to catch slack tide at Sergius Narrows at 1518. It was a very late time to leave, but passing at slack was the smart thing to do in turbulent areas. We hoped to get to Sukoi Inlet tonight, 12.5 NM away. It wasn't too far, but something always happens to hinder our progress. The currents here flow in so many different directions, we will have to break up the trip to Sitka over 2 days to make good use of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>At low tide, we saw a red dust cloud near our boat underwater. We think it was some variety of filamentous algae — a very strange sight. It wasn't visible at high tide yesterday, varying levels of tide reveal different details about a place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>We left at 1400 to make it in time for slack at Sergius Narrows. The entrance to Baby Bear Bay was a bit difficult to navigate today, because it was completely choked with bull kelp. The path was so clear yesterday, but today there was no way around it, we had to plow through, this was likely because the current and tides were different. We hate having run our engine through kelp, it's risky, we don't want to risk fouling the prop... especially in an area with lots of rocks and high currents.<br>The wind was blowing from the ocean entrance channel, making the water in the area extremely choppy. We hadn't expected this, the wind was curling into the passes as a southwest wind. This wasn't good, because we also had to fight the last of the opposing current to get to Sergius Narrows. Fucking sigh. Other boats were rushing towards it too, but weren't struggling because all had more engine power than we did.<br>A tug and barge appeared on the horizon at our stern. We maneuvered out of its way, staying out of the main channel to allow it to pass, but the tugboat captain hailed us on VHF to tell us to get out of the way. We were confused by this, because we could see the tug's position in relation to ours on AIS and that we weren't in the way. We moved further out of the channel to make it clearer that we weren't trying to proceed into the narrows. By that time, we were barely moving, just idling on the side of the channel, but he hailed us again, asking us to move further, so... we did. What else was there to do? When the tug finally passed us, there was more than enough room, we could have stayed where we were, but in moments like these, it's better to take their word for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>We passed through the rapids on time, but the waves on the other side were just nasty. We had 20 knots of wind at our bow, and the last of an opposing current to deal with... we were going terribly slow. After 10 minutes of beating into this mess, we heard the engine's low pressure alarm ring. "Oh fuck! What now?!" We turned the engine off immediately, and I went below to investigate. This sort of thing always happens at the worst possible time. We turned Pino around to have the wind at our stern, we opened the jib and ran downwind. When I opened the engine room, I felt the immense heat, the engine was crazy hot, and sweating, I couldn't get near it. Passing Kakul Narrows to get to Sukoi Inlet was not going to be possible today, it wouldn't be safe. We instead turned towards Piper Island with plans to troubleshoot the engine's problem at anchor. We think that it was likely that the engine was overworked.<br>We sailed over to Piper Island, our 15-foot oars were assembled and waiting the cockpit, should we need them. Once we arrived on the other side of the island we would lose the wind and would have to row to get to a suitable anchoring spot. We were nervous, because there were many shoals around the island to avoid. Unfortunately, 2 other boats were there at anchor, restricting space in an already very small anchorage, we had to make it past them. Some gusts curling around the island permitted us to move faster than we could using the oars. We made our way to the northeast end of the island. This place was less sheltered, but there were no other options. We dropped our anchor in 9 m (30 ft).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Once at anchor, I went below again to try and fix the issue. The engine was a bit cooler now, so I was able to check the oil level, the water strainer, etc. The oil level was fine, but I found a bit of algae in the strainer, maybe the fact that the engine was hot was due to the water flow being restricted? But I thought it curious that the overheating alarm hadn't gone off first. The wind will be a bit less tomorrow, it will be easier to exit Kakul Narrows. We are so close to Sitka, it really sucks to have to deal with this shit now...</td>

   <td><b>Piper Island to {Sitka}</b><hr>We had an early start at 0530. We spent a calm night at Piper Island, we were grateful that we got to rest properly, especially if today's run ends up being as hellish as yesterday's. The sky was grey, the air was cold, we could see that there was some wind out there, but it wasn't too strong. We turned the engine on, but only ran it at low speeds, just in case... we wanted to make sure we could get past the narrows. We had timed our departure with an outgoing current of 2 knots, which we thought would hasten our transit... it really did! We had some wind at our bow, but the current helped to offset it.<br>We arrived at Kakul Narrows quickly, it was a very different experience than yesterday. Some whales were feeding near the entrance. Whales were a very common sight in these waters, there are moments when we feel like it's just us, the water and the trees, it was easy to forget that there was life in the trees and underwater, birds, small mammals, fish, insects, etc. Even if we could not see them, we knew they were all there, we were honored when they chose to show themselves to us. Whales don't really surface because of us, to them we are a foreign unimportant passing thing, who will soon fall out of memory.</td>

<tr>
   <td>Once we made it out of the narrows, we saw some ocean swells. The swells meeting with the current generated confused seas, conditions weren't dangerous, just... messy. We raised our mainsail to help stabilize the boat in these erratic waves, and also to sail, because we now had the wind on the beam. We shut the engine and glided along. We decided to skip Sukoi Inlet, neither of us felt like going there, plus we were making good time.<br>While shielded, these waters ebb and flood in many different directions, turning at different times, making it hard to leave with one favorable current in one pass and to then catch the next one because it will already be running against us. Boats with large engines aren't as concerned about timing, but our experience yesterday confirmed that our little engine has clear limits, we were determined not to test them again.</td>

<tr>
   <td>We had 0.80 knots running against us in Navi Strait, not ideal when motoring, but fine when sailing. Sailing was free time, we could fly forever. We sailed at 2.3-2.6 knots, progress was constant, but slow. The good news was that we were early, the current would turn in our favor with us already halfway through the strait. The wind followed us between the islands, we weren't sure if it would. We poled out the jib and ran wing-on-wing. Wing-on-wing turns Pino into a much larger target for those who wished to overtake us.</td>

   <td>The wind stayed with us, we almost can't believe it! We thought we might not make it through Neva Strait fast enough before the current turned against us in Olga Strait, but we made it through on the last of the favorable current, 40 minutes before it turned! This morning, I was agonizing over timing, but this day felt like such a gift! We'd be arriving in Sitka today...! Our speed had increased now, and the sun had come out — yet another gift!<br>Once we made it out of Olga Strait, we used the engine to get past an area with headwinds, but every time we passed an islet, the wind would switch to an angle that we could sail.</td>

There were cars, roads, houses, we were close enough to see kids playing on the beach, it was like watching a set populated with automatons, it didn't feel real from afar. There was an otherness to them, we belonged in the water and they on firm ground. When we finally set foot on land, our worlds touch, and the spell wears off.<br>It really was a beautiful, beautiful day, the sky was a clear blue and all of Baranof Island's mountains were unobscured.</td>

   <td>We arrived past the Sitka Harbor breakwater at 1230. We searched around Eliason Harbor for a free spot on their transient dock, but they were all full of boats that looked like anything but transient, boats that had planted roots. We called the harbormaster on VHF to ask if there was an empty slip we could take, they directed us to a dock that could not quite accommodate our full length, but it was fine, we were happy to have arrived. Our fresh produce was thin, growing hairy, and soft, nearing decay.<br>We checked in, reported our arrival to the CBP and went out for a grocery run! Produce here was not cheap, but we were aching for good crunchy produce, we were sick to death of pliable carrots and sprouted potatoes. Like all of our arrivals into a big port, we wanted to eat hummus, but the bread sold here was soft french bread(again), not our favorite.<br>We eat at unpredictable hours these days, we had breakfast at 0600, lunch at 0930 and dinner at 2000. Underway, we ate when we were hungry, and we got hungry fast because we were always moving, hoisting something, maneuvering, and standing up all day. After dinner, we watched a movie and fell asleep.</td>

After my many walks, I became very familiar with the various fishing boats moored on the docks. A lot of young people work aboard the fishing boats, cleaning the decks, organizing nets, doing engine maintenance. We saw a lot of families with young kids aboard. Being moored in a working harbor was a nice change, we could only look at yachts with polished stainless steel for so long, yachts with decks so white that birds don't dare take a shit on them. The work boats here were tangles of gears, and no 2 boats were the same.</td>

A path followed the water's edge. It was a calm and lovely place, we walked there twice to enjoy the serenity and beautiful scenery.

   <td><b>{Sitka}</b><hr>Today I changed the engine's oil and filter. We plan to continue to rely on our own wings, but Calcifer II needs to work, there will be no one out there to tow us in and out of tight harbors. When doing maintenance on the engine, I noticed that the coolant level seemed low, but I wasn't sure how full it was supposed to be, having never before serviced that particular part of the engine. When leaving, I forgot to bring extra coolant along. I assumed that there was enough in the engine, and I didn't think we'd have to top it off because I was told to change it every 5 years, or so. It had not been 5 years yet, and we don't motor that much. The issue though was that it was not a good idea to top up coolant without know what was already there, and because the last change wasn't done by us, we didn't know what was put in there. Not ideal.<br><b>Note:</b><i>We switched our old Yanmar 2GM with a a rebuilt Yanmar 2GM20F in late 2021, when we did the switch the seller(someone in B.C renowned for his work on Marine engines) had topped it up with new coolant. We ought to have asked what it was, we just didn't think of it, having never had freshwater-cooled engine before.</i></td>

   <td><b>{Sitka}</b><hr>We hesitated to depart today, I kept thinking about the coolant, but despite this, we chose to leave. The engine was fine, initially, then I noticed less and less water coming out of the exhaust pipe. No alarm went off, but we figured it ringing was inevitable, so we switched the engine off, and I once again opened the engine room to investigate. There was algae in the strainer, again. I cleared it. We continued to sail slowly towards Kliuchevoi Bay, agonizing over the source of the problem all the while.<br>Making the decision to go back to Sitka was tough, our pride was getting in the way, we were closer to our anchorage than to Sitka by then. But we thought it safer to go back, so we did. We sailed back to Sitka at a slow 2.3 knots, running the engine at very low speeds when the wind wasn't around to help. Our speed never exceeded 2.4 knots. Luckily, the wind rose a little for a short time and brought our speed up to 3.4 knots.</td>

   <td>We arrived back into port at 1530, and crash landed into our former spot. The wind that had helped us get here was now a nuisance, pushing us away from our slip. We instead landed on the empty berth across from us. We used ropes to pull Pino back into its assigned slip, but Pino ended up laying diagonally between the two slips, and because of the wind I could't pull the bow over. Devine pushed on the stern and eventually, we were able to moor Pino properly. Oof.<br>We spent the rest of the evening ruling out possible blockages in the engine's cooling lines as a problem. I opened the water pump and checked the impeller, all was good. We tightened the water pump belt to eliminate this as a cause. We wonder if the smoke we saw was actually steam, we just don't know. That was all we could do today, because it was Sunday and we had to wait for a week day to buy some new coolant. We had spoken to the people in Sidney who worked on our rebuilt engine and we found a compatible equivalent.<br>Days like today suck, I am always hard on myself during such times, that I didn't do enough, that I didn't listen to the little voice in my head saying that leaving wasn't a good idea.

When watching the exhaust for smoke, Devine spotted some algae around the prop. We wondered how long it had been there for.
