<p>On June 20th 2025 we sailed to the San Juan Islands. Our goal was not to tour, but to meet up with friends on the south of Blakely Island on June 26th to the 29th.</p>

<p>Back in 2016, we had stopped in Aleck Bay for the night, but that had been our only stop in the San Juan Islands after exiting Deception Pass. After Aleck Bay we had leapt across back to Cadboro Bay in Canada. This time around, we sailed from Port Browning on Pender Island and into Parks Bay on Shaw Island. We checked into the US via the Roam app, saving us the trouble of checking in person in Friday Harbour.</p>

<p><b>Parks Bay (Shaw Island)</b>. There were 3 boats laying at anchor in Parks Bay when we arrived. It was Friday, lots of small runabouts where crabbing just outside of the anchorage, we counted around 20 boats with as many floats. The boats left in the evening but returned the next day, and the next(all weekend long). We anchored in 35 feet. Many more boats joined us later that day. We spent 3 days there, one in which was very rainy, and the last very foggy. We had meant to stay 2 days but on the morning of the 22nd we could not see past the end of the anchorage because of the thick fog. Because of all the ferry traffic in these waters we thought it prudent to wait for a clear day. We felt a bit of ferry wake here, but it was minimal. All of the shore was private, so we could not go out and stretch our legs. It was a lovely anchorage overall, far from the mess that is Friday Harbor, perfect with southwinds in the forecast, and it offers a lovely view of the sunset to the north.</p>

<p><b>Spencer Spit (Lopez Island)</b>. A lovely anchorage with a great view along the shore of a sand spit, northeast of Lopez Island. We left Parks Bay with a helpful current, it carried us at 6.7 knots initially, especially near Turn Point, but then chilled out a bit after that. We encountered a ferry in Upright Passage, but simply moved to the right side of the channel to allow it to pass. That morning all traffic on the water was commercial, ferries or small barges carrying semis or other vehicle. When we arrived, there was 1 boat at anchor and another on a mooring. We arrived at the lowest tide, and found the water to be very shallow. There were 7 mooring buoys on the north side at the time, and 2 on the south end. We anchored just south of the buoys on the north end in 20 feet at low tide. This was a very rolly anchorage, Frost island does not shield well from ferry or traffic wakes. The wakes were not so bad when there was a good wind blowing, but on calm days it could get a bit violent. Ashore is a very extension camping ground, with many trails that snake along the camping spots. Beaching the dinghy on the sand spit was easy enough, but harder at low tide because the ground isn't as steep (Rek had to put their feet in the water to pull the dinghy in closer). On shore, we found recycling and garbage bins, toilets(many), an abundance of picnic tables and some water taps.</p>
