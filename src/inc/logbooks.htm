<p>On some of our sailing trips, we kept a physical logbook documenting sea conditions, our progress, as well as our thoughts. Below are the transcriptions of these logbooks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>{North Pacific logbook} - The ocean between Japan and Canada, 2020</li>
	<li>{Victoria to Sitka logbook} - British Columbia(north and south) and Southeast Alaska, 2024</li>
</ul>
