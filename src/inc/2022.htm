<p>The rabbits are re-wiring {Pino}. So far this month, we spent entire afternoons removing, and passing new wires into the boat's walls and ceiling.

<p>Pino is back in the land of faster internet, and our boat's belly has been re-filled with food. We returned to the Gulf Islands, and are busy eating as many wild blackberries as we can stomach ('tis the season).</p>

<p>Our last anchorage in Desolation Sound was {tenedos bay}, a really lovely place with an amazing (vertical) hike, and clear, clear waters. We also wrote a post on {sturt bay} on Texada Island, a place we stopped on the way up earlier this year, and again when we traveled back south.</p>

<p>As mentioned brieftly in our last post, Devine has been working on an OS called <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/potato.html' target='_blank'>Potato</a>. Rek drew a <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/media/generic/potato.png' target='_blank'>mascot</a>, and another illustration featuring <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/media/generic/varvara.potato.png' target='_blank'>Varvara and Potato together</a>. Potato is for the Varvara computer, designed to fill the gaps where a host device might not have an underlying file system, like handheld consoles (many people use {uxn} on Nintendo DS).</p>

<p>Rek has been drawing a lot, their winter will consist of scanning and processing a sketchbook-full of art. We are still proofreading {Wiktopher}. A recent stop in Sidney permitted us to <a href='https://100r.co/media/content/projects/wiktopher_05.jpg' target='_blank'>print the entire book on paper</a> to make it easier (and more pleasant) to make corrections. The result is 70 (double-sided) pages of text. As of today, we have gone over and marked in red the first chapter (out of 12). Editing books is never easy or fast, but we'll get there.</p>

<p>We know a couple of people have made <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/hako.html' target='_blank'>hako</a> dice sets, so we feel bad for "patching" a physical game, but the face organization of the die has changed somewhat, now, the opposing sides are always of equal value.

<p>Sometimes we find an anchorage that is so nice, so ideal, that we end up staying for weeks. We stayed in Von Donop Bay ({hathayim marine park}) for well over a month. The southernmost anchorage is near many trails that snake and branch out deep into the woods, and the bay is so large that we kept finding new corners to explore by dinghy. The water in the area is warmer than in Victoria, we can dive, and check Pino's bottom without freezing. This is our first real summer on the boat, when we have no big boat projects to do, nor big transits to plan, and it feels amazing.</p>

<p>We have stretched our food stores to the limit (it has been 2 months since we last stocked up in full). A 5 km trek through the woods takes us to a little General Store, they never have fresh produce (or it gets bought out before we get there) but we go once in a while to replenish our stock of potatoes and onions. We are relying on sprouts a lot (see {growing food}).</p>

<p>From this month until next October, our updates may be delayed. We are sailing northward, towards Desolation Sound and the Broughtons, where cell towers are few. We will wander in and out of such regions all summer. So far, we sailed up to the Gulf Islands, and over to Nanaimo from Victoria, and then crossed the Strait of Georgia over to the Sunshine Coast(close-reaching in 20-knot winds). This was a good shakedown for Pino, a good way to re-awaken our little vessel. All went well, but we ought to have secured our produce better... some of our potatoes escaped their nest and went out for an afternoon roll around the cabin floor.</p>

<p>Start of May, we had some issues with our batteries. They've been acting out for some time, we think because of a dead cell. We have been operating at half battery capacity for a month, and realized that yet again we don't need that much power, especially in the summer when the days are long.</p>

<p>The combinatory logic guide is the first of many projects we plan to release this summer. We also released an <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal_reference.html' target='_blank'>sign language version of Uxntal</a>.</p>

In these waters, it is often necessary to stern tie to shore when anchoring and the spindle will make it easier to uncoil the line.</p>

<p>We also took some time off to visit some ancient trees in {cathedral grove} on Vancouver Island.</p>
