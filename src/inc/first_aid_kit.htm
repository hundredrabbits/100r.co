<p><b>Basic First-aid kit:</b></p>

<img src="../media/content/knowledge/firstaidkit.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="a Canadian First-aid Kit">

<p>Clearly mark the first-aid kit with a <b>red cross</b>, and make sure everyone aboards knows where it is. Keep a list inside of the items you use, and be sure to top off the kit every year or so. Also, see {ditch bag}.</p>

<p>Do not get all of the items below without doing thorough research yourself. You may not need all of these items. Do not blindly buy a pre-made kit, make a list of likely ailments and situations and get good quality medicine and first-aid kit items individually(sourced in-person from local pharmacies).</p>

<p>Make sure that you understand how to administer medicine, or to practice wound care, to a patient before attempting it. Take a first-aid course, read manuals, etc.</p>

<p>We'll say it again, when assembling a first-aid or a medicine kit, consult rigorously peer-reviewed scientific research, make a list, and get individual items suited for your unique needs and situation.</p>
