<p>On June 2020, we left Shimoda JP to sail straight to {Victoria}, laying 8,210 km (4433 nm) away. The passage took 51 days.</p>

<p>During our North Pacific crossing we kept a detailed journal of the day’s events. We wrote most entries while off-watch, whenever we had some free time. The handwritten journal, the {North Pacific Logbook} was transcribed and published online, before being revised and published as an e-book called {Busy Doing Nothing}.</p>

<p>On this passage, we lost a 100 W solar panel and our spray hood (dodger) after being hit by a large wave. Our engine also accumulated issues, and same goes for our headsail, {jib cars} and interior wood. 4 years of hard sailing has taken its toll on our little boat, we now have to replace the running rigging, upholstery, chainplates, dinghy, cabin wiring etc. We plan to spend a few winters in {Victoria} to fix up Pino, spreading costs over a long period of time to permit our finances to recover. If you want to help fund our replacement gear, see our {support} page, every little bit helps!</p>
