<p>Our work schedule is tied to the weather, as we depend on solar energy to {power} our computers. By looking at the forecast, we can determine when we will get the most work done: consecutive days of sun grant us enough power for video editing, while overcast days are reserved for low-power work, like writing, coding and planning.</p>

<p>In the constraints of expensive cell phone data, uploading large files can be made possible by offloading heavy-lifting onto remote servers; having your <b>server build and upload your projects</b> instead of using your laptop batteries and broadband.</p>

<p>There is no solution to uploading videos to YouTube, it's a costly and lengthy process. When we make {videos}, we keep them under 5 minutes to help reduce upload time.</p>

<p>We work less, by keeping our needs small. We both cannot deal with working within rigid schedules, and we both know that we find our best selves when working close to nature.</p>
