<p>The Uxn/Varvara ecosystem is a <b>personal computing stack</b> based on a <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/etc/uxnmin.c.txt' target='_blank'>small virtual machine</a> that lies at the heart of our software, and that allows us to run the same application on a variety of systems.</p>

<p>It is designed with an <a href='weathering_software_winter.html'>implementation-first</a> mindset and is tailored to our specific needs for hosting graphical applications, but is entirely open and welcomes anyone to adopt it as a release target. Uxn is programmable in its own unique <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal.html' target='_blank'>language</a>, and the distribution of Uxn programs is akin to sharing game roms for classic console emulators, to learn more, see our notes on {uxn design}. </p>

<p>To run Uxn programs, you will need an emulator that works on your system. Below are links to emulators for major operating systems, and for a more <a href="https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn#emulators">obscure environments</a>. Alternatively, you can also <b>implement your own</b> by looking a the <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html' target='_blank'>VM specs</a>, the <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/varvara.html' target='_blank'>IO specs</a> and the <a href='https://sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>source code</a>.</p>

<p><b>MACOS.</b> For now, the only way to get the Uxn emulator running on OS X is to build it from the source files, which means cloning or <a href="https://sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn/" target="_blank">downloading the repository</a> on Sourcehut and writing <i>.build.sh</i>. Apple makes it very difficult to distribute software for those who don't have access to Apple devices. If you need a hand, join us on IRC (#uxn on irc.libera.chat) or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/N5yEJY7q" target="_blank">Discord</a>.</p>

<p>Once equipped with an emulator, you can pick among these <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn#applications' target='_blank'>toys, games and tools</a>, write your own programs or try ours:</p>

<ul style='columns:2'>
  <li>{Oquonie}, a bizzare universe</li>
  <li>{Donsol}, a card dungeon crawler</li>
  <li>{Left}, our text editor</li>
  <li>{Noodle}, a drawing program</li>
  <li>{Orca}, the livecoding environment</li> 
  <li>{Nasu}, a sprite editor</li>
  <li><a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/turye.html' target='_blank'>Turye</a>, a font editor</li>
  <li><a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/catclock.html' target='_blank'>Catclock</a>, a desktop clock</li>
