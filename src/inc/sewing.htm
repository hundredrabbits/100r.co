<p>There are plenty of sewing projects to do on a boat. We carry a sewing awl (Speedy Stitcher) to make quick repairs without a machine. Inside the body, there is space to hold a fair quantity of thread. We use it to repair heavy canvas and sails.</p>

<p>The Speedy Stitcher comes with diamond point needles, and heavy waxed thread. It sews a perfect lock stitch just like a sewing machine. With it, we're repaired our sails, our backpacks, and our boat canvas.</p>

<p>To make more complex projects we use a sewing machine. We've owned 2 machines, the <a href="../media/content/knowledge/sewing_machine.jpg" target="_blank">first</a>(secondhand from a friend, acquired in 2021) was nothing special, we couldn't even go in reverse with it, but it did basic stitching and worked quite well, plus it came with a briefcase which helps to protect it against moisture and corrosion. We used it to make our {mini dodger} and {boom tent}. In December 2023 we parted with our old sewing machine and got a <a href="../media/content/inventory/sailrite_01.jpg">Sailrite Ultrafeed LSZ</a> sewing machine to be able to do more heavy duty projects (see {upholstery}).</p>

<p>Prior to owning a sewing machine ourselves, during our circumnavigation of the Pacific, we often borrowed <a href='../media/content/knowledge/sailrite.jpg' target='_blank'>our friend's machine</a>. We've also had other friends graciously re-stitch our canvas, at no cost — whenever possible, we adopt a pay-it-forward strategy when helping others, inspired by all who have come to our aid in the past(mentorship, tool-lending, making small repairs, etc). Borrowing worked for a long time for us, owning a machine is not always necessary; good machines are expensive, heavy and take up a lot of room aboard.</p>

<p>Repairing sails aboard a boat is possible, but difficult. Tables on smaller boats are too short and narrow, and the space makes it too hard to lay panels flat. For such repairs, we try and seek out outside spaces to do the work. While in Minamiise in Japan, the harbourmaster let us use the yatch club's loft, as well as <a href="../media/content/boat_projects/sail_03.jpg">their machine</a> to fix our {headsail}.</p>

<aside class="notice">Note that we didn't buy all of this gear at once, we've accumulated the lot since 2016, much of it is purchased secondhand(thrift stores), or from dollar stores(great for needles, rulers, tape, etc). We sometimes go to places that manufacture outdoor upholstery/awnings and get fabric off-cuts for a reduced price, sometimes for free, to make smaller sewing projects, or to practice with.</aside>
