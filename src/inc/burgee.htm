<p>A burgee is a kind of distinguising maritime flag, flown by members of sailing communities. <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/merveilles.html' target='_blank'>Merveilles</a> is an art group consisting of forward-thinking individuals who strive to better each other and their surroundings through constant creation and play. The burgee was designed by our friend <a href='https://ritualdust.com/' target='_blank'>Lizbeth</a>.</p>

<p>The Merveilles burgee, showing the moon rising over its reflection on a cyan sea at night, is flown by members of its community to find each other out there. </p>
