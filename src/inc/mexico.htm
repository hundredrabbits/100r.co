<p>In November 2016, we sailed into Ensenada, Estados Unidos Mexicanos(United Mexican States) from San Diego. We stayed in its foggy waters for a month, before moving around the Baja Peninsula to go to La Paz. We made 3 stops on the way there: Bahía Tortugas, Puerto Los Cabos and Isla Espirito Santo.</p>

<p>We stayed in La Paz for 2 months, making several outings to nearby anchorages, like Bahía Falsa, Playa Balandra, Bahía Bonanza, Puerto Ballena, Bahía de Los Muertos etc. A freshmarket in La Paz sold the most amazing produce we've ever had, they were even able to get us some unripe tomatoes(with an advanced notice) for our passage to the Marquesas.</p>

<p>Our favorite food there was nopales, and chipotle peppers.</p>
