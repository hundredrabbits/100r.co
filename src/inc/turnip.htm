<p>Turnip is a Honda 2.3 HP outboard motor, a 4-stroke air-cooled model. We bought it in San Diego in October 2016. When paired with {Iggy}, Turnip carried us safely from ship to shore.</p>

<p>At the start of our jump from {Mexico} to {French Polynesia} in 2017, we added angry eyes and eyebrows to the hood. We like how Turnip appeared to be constantly displeased with us from afar.</p>

<p>On April 10th 2021, Turnip was passed down to another owner and later that same year we purchased {Teapot}, a good rowing dinghy, eliminating the need for an outboard.</p>
