<p>On June 29th, we left {Sturt Bay} on Texada Island at 10h00, hoping that the wind would be as pleasant as it had been the previous day, sailing from Thunder Bay (Maude Bay). We glided out of Sturt Bay under full main and jib, but as soon as we got near Ahgykson Island, the wind ran out of steam, leaving Pino bobbing stupidly in the water.</p>

<p>Calcifer awoke and propelled us on, past Savary Island, past Lund, past the Copelands. We knew our friend Peter was anchored on Mink Island, but we had our heart set on Roscoe Bay on West Redonda Island.</p>

<p>We had wind again past Sarah Point, when turning into Desolation. It helped push us toward our anchorage.</p>

<p>Roscoe Bay is on the lower east side of West Redonda Island, it's a fair-sized anchorage guarded by a shallow bar at the entrance. The bar dries at 0.8m (2.62 ft). If using Navionics, the tide level of the bar is 3.5 below Twin Islands. For those using CHS Tides, the tide level of the bar is 3 ft less than Prideaux Haven.</p>

<p>We entered the bay on a rising tide, and at the bar we had 8 feet under our keel. We dropped anchor at the far western end of the bay. With 18 ft under our keel at high tide (7.8 ft at the lowest). There were 3 other boats when we came in. Devine had us anchor not too far from shore, so that we could stern-tie, should the anchorage get busier.</p>

<p>On July 1st, we were completely alone. Everyone had left.</p>

<p>Then days later, more boats started coming in (including Peter), and we decided to stern-tie to shore (50°9.615'N, 124°46.260'W). This part of the bay is shallower, but even on a low low tide, with Pino's butt near the shore, we had 6.5 ft under the keel.</p>

<h2>Mt. Llanover</h2>

<p>There are many walks near Roscoe Bay, the most well-trodden route is the short one leading to Black Lake. Another near where we are anchored leads to the top of Mt. Llanover. We left to do this trail at 10h00, along with Peter, Julia and Finnigan the dog. The trail is steep at times, but unlike the Trapper's Cabin Trail in {Princess Louisa Inlet}, this one also has a lot of flats.</p>

<p>The trail has several markers, the first being the logging road, then the wetlands, the large tire, and the rusty welding tank. Much of the walk crisscrosses a dried stream (dry at this time of the year, anyway). Near the top, both Julia and Devine got stung by bees, they thought it was smart to make a nest at ground level on the trail.</p>

<p>We made it to the top about two hours, a bit over 4km later.</p>

<p>The top lies at 683m(2241ft), and offers amazing views of Desolation Sound, Cortes Island, Pendrell Sound, the far away mountain ranges of Vancouver Island (summit: 50°10.745'N, 124°47.462'W).</p>

<h3>Black Lake</h3>

<p>A freshwater lake just a short row/walk away is a hell of a treat. We went there to cool off, or to wash up on multiple occasions. A sign warns swimmers not to use soap.</p>
