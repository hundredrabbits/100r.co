<p>In March 2017, we spent 28 days at sea sailing to French Polynesia from La Paz, {Mexico}. This country covers a large patch of ocean, it is a collection of 118 geographically dispersed islands and atolls stretching more than 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) in the South Pacific.</p>

<p>We spent 3 months sailing around its various islands, making stops in Nuku Hiva, Rangiroa, Tahiti, Moorea, Huahine and Raiatea. We completed {Thousand Rooms} in Nuku Hiva, {Left} in Tahiti, and started {Wiktopher} while in Huahine.</p>

<p>While in Nuku Hiva, Devine contracted dengue, and so we spent a bit more time moored there than we had planned.</p>

<p>The islands are full of beautiful reef fish, sea birds and tropical fruit. The most memorable fruit being the pamplemousse, and the breadfruit. The next stop on our trip was Rarotonga in the {Cook Islands}.</p>
