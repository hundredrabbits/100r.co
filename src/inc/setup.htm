<p>We carry many devices onboard, some for everyday tasks, while others are reserved for low-power situations.</p>

<p>In 2016, we moved aboard Pino with MacbookPro 2012s, one of them died in Mexico in late 2016 and the other in a damp locker in 2025. A friend gave us a used MacbookPro 17", but it was too power-hungy for the boat, and it later died in 2020 during our passage from Japan to Canada across the {North Pacific Ocean}(a giant jar of umeshu exploded over it).</p>

<p>Most of our computers are secondhand, donated to the studio between 2017 and now. We'd like to thank the following people: <a href='https://twitter.com/thisismyclone' target='_blank'>Josh Auget</a> for the x250Thinkpad, John Eternal for the MacbookPro 13" 2010, and <a href='https://lloydwilliams.co/' target='_blank'>Lloyd Williams</a> for the MacbookAir 2013 11".</p>

<p>We accept laptop donations, but they can't be too power hungry and they must be located within Canada.</p>
