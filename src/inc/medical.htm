<p>Most city-centers will have a hospital. Ones out in the islands—South Pacific for instance—tend to be good and cheap, but in most cases you must be self-sufficient. That includes a well-stocked medical supply, and the know-how to fix yourself up.</p>

<p>Before going {offshore}, if you can, we recommend doing a <b>first-aid course</b>. Knowing what to do in the event of severe bleeding, choking, or severe allergic reactions, could save your crew's life.</p>

<p>In a marine environment, it may not be possible for EMS personnel to come to your assistance in an emergency. You may need to contact a doctor and request advice on providing care, even if it is outside of your training. Read about  {calling for help} on a boat. Document the doctor’s orders carefully.</p>

<p>You should prepare the following information and present it to the doctor:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Routine information about the ship</li>
	<li>Routine information about the person</li>
	<li>Details of the illness/injury</li>
	<li>Care rendered and the person’s response to that care</li>
</ul>

<p>Read on what to do to protect yourself against {malaria}, and see what to do in the event of {jellyfish stings}, {sunburns}, or {hypothermia}.</p>

<p><b>DAN BOATER</b></p>

<p> In case of a serious injury, you must have the means to get yourself to the nearest clinic. We use <a href='http://danboater.org' target='_blank'>DAN Boater</a>, a <b>repatriation insurance</b> that covers helicopter/transportation fees.</p>

<p><b>MEDICAL RESOURCES</b></p>

<p>We find that <b>medical apps for mobiles, and FM army field manuals</b>, are helpful when dealing with minor burns, cuts and various aches. If you have a smart phone, the <b>Canadian Red Cross app</b> is free, works offline, and is very good.</p>

<p>We also recommend:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href='https://riotmedicine.net/downloads/' target='_blank'>downloadable guides by Riot Medicine</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=F4D7E7B3AD83AC012827785EA07DF686' target='_blank'>A Barefoot Doctor’s Manual: The American Translation of the Official Chinese Paramedical Manual</a>(an excellent general health manual)</li>
</ul>
