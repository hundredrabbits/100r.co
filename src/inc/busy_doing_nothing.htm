<p>In 2020, we completed our circumnavigation of the Pacific ocean. The last passage from {Japan} (Shimoda) to Canada (Victoria) took 51 days, and it was the hardest thing we've ever done. We decided to keep a physical logbook of daily happenings onboard.</p>

<p>Upon our arrival, we transcribed the handwritten pages, so we could publish them online.</p>

<p>In fall 2020, we decided to expand on it, and to release it as a digital book. We revised most of the text, added new art and expanded on specific logs.</p>

<p>The book was written in Markdown and formatted to PDF and EPUB using <a href='https://www.latex-project.org/' target="_blank">LaTeX</a> and CSS via <a href='https://pandoc.org/' target="_blank">Pandoc</a>. The first edition of Busy Doing Nothing was released on February 17th 2021. The book is <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/thebook' target="_">open source</a>, but buying it is a way of supporting our work. The {North Pacific Logbook} is still online, but does not include new content.</p>

<p>In December 2021, we finally formatted and released a paperback version of the book. We settled on using Lulu.com, since they provide a very good print-on-demand service and that we can't physically keep many copies of physical books on the boat due to space (and moisture) constraints.</p>
