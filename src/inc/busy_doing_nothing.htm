<p>Busy Doing Nothing is the revised and improved {North Pacific Logbook}. It is 218 pages long, written in English. The book has 51 new drawings, 16 new sections on a variety of topics and 19 recipes.</p>

<p>We are artist and sailors, and have been living, and working from our sailboat {Pino} since 2016. In 2020, we completed our circumnavigation of the Pacific ocean. The last passage from {Japan} ({Shimoda}) to Canada ({Victoria}) took 51 days, and it was the hardest thing we've ever done. We decided to keep a physical logbook of daily happenings onboard.</p>

<p>Upon our arrival, we transcribed the handwritten pages, so we could publish them online. Weeks later, we decided to expand on it, to release it as a digital book. We revised most of the text, expanded on specific logs, and added:

<ul>
	<li>51 new drawings</li>
    <li>16 new sections<br>
        Seasickness, Kuroshio, Sailing at night, Heaving-to, Squalls, Food, Self-steering, Food storage, Water, Birds and nature, Computers, The burden of electronics, Thrift and care, Catching rain, Coping with stress, Foul-weather gear and Pino's Japanese pantry.</li>
    <li>19 recipes</li>
</ul>

<p>Busy Doing Nothing is in black and white, it is <b>218 pages</b> long, written in English, and formatted for e-readers. The first version is still available to read online, but doesn't include the newer content and revised text. Buying this book is a way to support us, we put a lot of work into it, and we hope you like it!</p>

<p>In 2020, we completed our circumnavigation of the Pacific ocean. The last passage from {Japan} (Shimoda) to Canada (Victoria) took 51 days, and it was the hardest thing we've ever done. We decided to keep a physical logbook of daily happenings onboard.</p>

<p>Upon our arrival, we transcribed the handwritten pages, so we could publish them online.</p>

<img src='../media/content/projects/busydoingnothing_02.png' loading='lazy' alt='A closeup of the handwritten ship log featuring a rough drawing of a character sitting under a cloud of rain with the words: this is fine' title='A page from the physical logbook we kept on the trip'/>

<p>In fall 2020, we decided to expand on it, and to release it as a digital book. We revised most of the text, added new art and expanded on specific logs.</p>

<p>The book was written in Markdown and formatted to PDF and EPUB using <a href='https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/' target="_blank">Tectonic</a> and CSS via <a href='https://pandoc.org/' target="_blank">Pandoc</a>. The first edition of Busy Doing Nothing was released on February 17th 2021. The book is <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/busydoingnothing' target="_">open source</a>, but buying it is a way of supporting our work. The {North Pacific Logbook} is still online, but does not include new content.</p>

<p>In December 2021, we finally formatted and released a paperback version of the book. We settled on using Lulu.com, since they provide a very good print-on-demand service and that we can't physically keep many copies of physical books on the boat due to space (and moisture) constraints.</p>

<p>As of December 10th 2024, we have sold <b>521 copies</b> of the paperback book, and <b>1,014 copies</b> of the digital version, for a grand total of 1535 copies. Thank you all so much. We are so grateful, especially considering it was self-published and that we chose not to distribute through big online stores like Amazon.</p>

<p>The book is printed on demand. Lulu.com works with printers all over the world, so that most copies are produced locally and travel relatively short distances. It can take 3 to 5 work days to print the book. Since the books are printed, packaged, and shipped by humans, mistakes may happen. If your book arrives in less-than-perfect condition, <a href='https://help.lulu.com/en/support/solutions/articles/64000255314-providing-digital-defect-images' target='_blank'>contact Lulu.com</a> with images of shipping damage or printing errors, and they will send you another copy.</p>
