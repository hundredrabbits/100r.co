<p>We bought {Pino} in North Saanich, British Columbia, Canada in 2016. We left in August 2016 to circumnavigate the Pacific Ocean. We returned to our home waters in August 2020 after our {north pacific ocean} crossing from {Japan}.</p>

<p>We are most familiar with the anchorages, weather and current of the Salish Sea, between Victoria and Desolation Sound. The best time for sailing is in late spring and early fall, in the shoulder season. August is typically a very quiet month, with heavy occurrences of fog, especially near Juan de Fuca Strait. Winters days are short, cold, and stormy. The Salish Sea is sheltered from heavy weather systems by Vancouver Island, which funnels winds from the south, or the north. Because it is sheltered, and dotted with islands, there are a lot of strong currents, especially in narrow passes. In fact, most of the B.C. coast requires a sailor to contend with currents, especially in the area north of Desolation Sound and up to Cape Scott.</p>

<p>The Salish Sea is very dry in the summer months, it is easier to get fuel than water in the Gulf Islands, but the weather north of the Yuculta and Dent Rapids changes dramatically, it is often cold, rainy, and foggy, and water is plentiful. The typically summer pattern is for overcast mornings, with fog, which dissipate during afternoon as the wind comes up.</p>

<p>There is too much to say about the many regions of this wonderful coast, spending time in each one, observing weather patterns, is the very best way to learn.</p>

<h3><a id='tidecurrentresources'>Tide and Current Resources</a></h3>

<p>The tide and current situation makes it tricky to sail in BC, but there are many resources to make it easier to safely plan a sail. We always refer to the CHS Current and Tide Tables[<a href="#1">1</a>] and/or Ports and Passes Tides and Tables[<a href="#2">2</a>] when going through high-current passes like Dodd's Narrows, Porlier Pass or more dangerous rapids like Seymour Narrows, Dent Rapids, and Malibu Rapids.</p>

<p>The Canadian Hydrographic Service also has a Current Atlas[<a href="#3">3</a>] in print that makes it easier to visualize how the current moves between the numerous islands populating the Salish Sea(Strait of Georgia and Juan de Fuca Strait). Looking up the month, day, and time in the Current Atlas Tables[<a href="#4">4</a>] will indicate the correct current chart to refer to in the Current Atlas. This book is very useful, the current patterns change a lot during the year. Current swirls around small islands, it can run with you one day on an ebb, but turn against you on an ebb the next month - this is true when sailing north from Sidney to Galiano Island, depending on the time of the year, we sometimes have to go east, or west of Portland island on a flood to make good progress northward. The Current Atlas Tables show this clearly, the tables help you make better progress while saving fuel(if motoring).</p>

<h3><a id='windweatherresources'>Wind and Weather Resources</a></h3>

<p>To sail the Inside Passage waters, tools like Windy or Predict Wind aren't always accurate, the geography of this coast is complex, it affects the wind in curious ways that are not always reflected in their predictions.</p>

<p>For more accurate wind forecasts, look at the conditions reported by specific buoys, automated stations and lighthouses scattered along the coast[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a> and <a href="#7">7</a>](click on the Weather Conditions tab and select the desired buoy or land station). To learn how land affects these waters(inflow/outflow winds, cape effects, sea breezes etc), read books by local authors like Marilyn Johnson[<a href="#8">8</a>].</p>
