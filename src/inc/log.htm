<h3>News</h3>

<p>The rabbits are re-wiring {Pino}. So far this month, we spent entire afternoons removing, and passing new wires into the boat's walls and ceiling. This project has taken up most of our time this month. For updates on the project, see {dc electrical refit}. We also released an edited transcript of Devine's talk {weathering software winter}, for those who prefer to read.</p>

<p>We forgot to mention it in the last update, but Compudanzas just released a new version of their <a href='https://compudanzas.itch.io/introduction-to-uxn-programming/devlog/451234/version-104-launcher-and-raw-runes' target='_blank'>introduction to uxn programming book</a>!

<h3>News</h3>

<p>Pino is in Victoria again, and we're diving back into our favorite fall activities like pumpkin carving (see {halloween_pumpkins}), and fruit picking. The boat is now filled with <a href='http://grimgrains.com/site/chunky_apple_jam.html' target='_blank'>apple jam</a>. October was a drawing month for the both of us. Devine participated in drawtober and completed <a href='https://forum.merveilles.town/thread/58/drawtober-92/#bottom' target='_blank'>28 drawings</a> using {Noodle}. Rekka finished a <a href='http://kokorobot.ca/site/chase.html' target='_blank'>sequence</a> for the ongoing comic project <a href='http://kokorobot.ca/site/hakum.html' target='_blank'>Hakum</a>.</p>

<h3>News</h3>

<p>The days are getting shorter, and so is the time that we can spend on the computer, due to our batteries depleting earlier a bit each day. So, Devine spends evenings proof-reading the {Wiktopher} manuscript, reading and messing around with the Playdate, and Rekka continues ink work on an <a href='https://merveilles.town/@rek/109031721721868768' target='_blank'>upcoming project</a>(Mastodon) (no project page yet).</p>

<p>While cleaning up the boat, Devine found two small black notebooks. We started paging through them, to see if we should keep them. The notebooks were full of sketches, interspersed with shopping lists, and incomplete logs from earlier sailing trips we'd done. We found logs detailing our very first attempt at sailing offshore, our sail down the US West Coast and Mexico, and our passage from Tonga to New Zealand. We read the logs, and decided to transcribe and publish them online. Read the {lost logbook}.</p>

<p>Devine wrote a little <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/arduino-cookbook/tree/main/item/adafruit-playground/teatime.ino' target='_blanl'>timer program</a> for the Adafruit Playground. </p>

<h3>News</h3>

<p>Pino is back in the land of faster internet, and our boat's belly has been re-filled with food. We returned to the Gulf Islands, and are busy eating as many wild blackberries as we can stomach ('tis the season).</p>

<p>Our last anchorage in Desolation Sound was {tenedos bay}, a really lovely place with an amazing (vertical) hike, and clear, clear waters. We also wrote a post on {sturt bay} on Texada Island, a place we stopped on the way up earlier this year, and again when we traveled back south.</p>

<p>As mentioned brieftly in our last post, Devine has been working on an OS called <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/potato.html' target='_blank'>Potato</a>. Rekka drew a <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/media/generic/potato.png' target='_blank'>mascot</a>, and another illustration featuring <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/media/generic/varvara.potato.png' target='_blank'>Varvara and Potato together</a>. Potato is for the Varvara computer, designed to fill the gaps where a host device might not have an underlying file system, like handheld consoles (many people use {uxn} on Nintendo DS).</p>

<p>Rekka has been drawing a lot, their winter will consist of scanning and processing a sketchbook-full of art. We are still proofreading {Wiktopher}. A recent stop in Sidney permitted us to <a href='https://100r.co/media/content/projects/wiktopher_05.jpg' target='_blank'>print the entire book on paper</a> to make it easier (and more pleasant) to make corrections. The result is 70 (double-sided) pages of text. As of today, we have gone over and marked in red the first chapter (out of 12). Editing books is never easy or fast, but we'll get there.</p>

<p>We know a couple of people have made <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/hako.html' target='_blank'>hako</a> dice sets, so we feel bad for "patching" a physical game, but the face organization of the die has changed somewhat, now, the opposing sides are always of equal value.

<h3>News</h3>

<p>Sometimes we find an anchorage that is so nice, so ideal, that we end up staying for weeks. We stayed in Von Donop Bay ({hathayim marine park}) for well over a month. The southernmost anchorage is near many trails that snake and branch out deep into the woods, and the bay is so large that we kept finding new corners to explore by dinghy. The water in the area is warmer than in Victoria, we can dive, and check Pino's bottom without freezing. This is our first real summer on the boat, when we have no big boat projects to do, nor big transits to plan, and it feels amazing.</p>

<p>We have stretched our food stores to the limit (it has been 2 months since we last stocked up in full). A 5 km trek through the woods takes us to a little General Store, they never have fresh produce (or it gets bought out before we get there) but we go once in a while to replenish our stock of potatoes and onions. We are relying on sprouts a lot (see {growing food}).</p>

<p>This month, we made a <a href='https://nime2022.org/' target='_blank' class='external'>Keynote talk for Nime 2022</a>, and Devine started work on a little OS project called <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/potato.html' target='_blank'>Potato</a>, see <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/108744100597665776' target='_blank'>some footage</a>(Mastodon).

<p>Pino is currently in Desolation Sound, enjoying the quiet. We've written a few posts about some of the anchorages we've visited, like {melanie cove}, {grace harbour} and {hathayim marine park}. We're updating <a href='https://100r.co/site/about_us.html#where' target='_blank'>our track</a> as we go.</p>

<p>Devine has been adding a lot of notes to the <a href='https://permacomputing.net' target='_blank'>permacomputing wiki</a> this month. We also started a little arcade game named Inle, something that we could play together on the boat in the style of Gunbound/Tank Wars... but with rabbits (we finished reading Watership Down last month, so we blame that, haha). We don't have a project page yet for it, but we shared some images on the post for {grace harbour}, where we started working on the game.</p>

<h3>News</h3>

<p>From this month until next October, our updates may be delayed. We are sailing northward, towards Desolation Sound and the Broughtons, where cell towers are few. We will wander in and out of such regions all summer. So far, we sailed up to the Gulf Islands, and over to Nanaimo from Victoria, and then crossed the Strait of Georgia over to the Sunshine Coast(close-reaching in 20-knot winds). This was a good shakedown for Pino, a good way to re-awaken our little vessel. All went well, but we ought to have secured our produce better... some of our potatoes escaped their nest and went out for an afternoon roll around the cabin floor.</p>

<p>Start of May, we had some issues with our batteries. They've been acting out for some time, we think because of a dead cell. We have been operating at half battery capacity for a month, and realized that yet again we don't need that much power, especially in the summer when the days are long.</p>

<p>The combinatory logic guide is the first of many projects we plan to release this summer. We also released an <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal_reference.html' target='_blank'>sign language version of Uxntal</a>.</p>

In these waters, it is often necessary to stern tie to shore when anchoring and the spindle will make it easier to uncoil the line.</p>

<p>We also took some time off to visit some ancient trees in {cathedral grove} on Vancouver Island.</p>

<p>A major update to our wiki is that we've put together a text with our stance on various political aspects. Because of the decentralized nature of some of our work, and because of the overlap of libertarians and right-wing doomsday preppers and our documenting survivalism at sea, there were things that just had to be spelled out quite clearly. See {philosophy}. We've appended a notice to our {off the grid} page too, since it gets shared the most.</p>

<p>A lot of our time this month was dedicated to preparing for our keynote talk for <a href='https://libreplanet.org/2022/program/' target='_blank'>LibrePlanet 2022</a> called Software Doldrums. If you missed it the talk was recorded, watch it <a href='https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/software-doldrums/' target='_blank'>here</a>. Rekka illustrated all of the slides for the presentation, gathered <a href='https://kokorobot.ca/site/fsftalk.html' target='_blank'>here</a>. These images are now scattered on our wiki. Devine built the {Uxn} slideshow program <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/adelie.html' target='_blank'>Adelie</a> for that presentation, we plan to use it again for all future talks.</p>

<p>The day prior, Devine gave a <a href='https://youtu.be/h1eC8czDAkk' target='_blank'>short performance</a>(YouTube) for <a href='https://ten.algorave.com/' target='_blank'>Algorave's 10-year anniversary</a>, alongside over 140+ artists. The event was 24 hours, with everyone playing a 10-minute set.</p>

<p>Uxn was featured on The Verge, in an article entitled <a href='https://www.theverge.com/22935074/hundred-rabbits-uxn-roms-preservation' target='_blank'>These artists are making tiny ROMs that will probably outlive us all</a>. And Devine was <a href='https://medium.com/behind-the-screens-challenge/behind-the-screens-aliceffekt-3394fa66e625' target='_blank'>interviewed</a>(Medium) for <a href='https://medium.com/behind-the-screens-challenge' target='_blank'>Behind the Screens</a>.</p>

<p>In other news, we finally made some <a href='https://100r.co/site/store.html#stickers'>Uxn sticker sheets</a>!</p>
