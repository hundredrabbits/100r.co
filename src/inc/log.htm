<p>Pino returned to the Victoria docks a little early this year so Devine could go to <a href='https://thestrangeloop.com' target='_blank'>Strange Loop 2023</a>. We had a lovely sail that day, with clear skies, and 10 kts on the beam. Despite being a little food and sleep deprived, Devine's presentation went well, we will share the recording here once it is released.</p>

<p>Rek has been busy editing {Wiktopher}, finessing the conlangs featured in the story. One of the featured languages is Ilken, a whistled language, designed for long-distance communication, and playable with instruments. A few years ago Devine designed a language for it, but we decided to instead use a modern variation of <a href='http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/solresol.html' target='_blank'>Solresol</a>, a musical language by Jean-François Sudre. Rek <a href='http://wiki.xxiivv.com/media/refs/mimi.jpg' target='_blank'>drew a fanart of the mascot of Solresol</a>, and Devine a <a href='http://wiki.xxiivv.com/media/diary/826.jpg' target='_blank'>communication lantern</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, Devine is working at translating {Thousand Rooms}(Famimi Remisolla) in Solresol as practice. We're also editing a Brazilian Portuguese version, to be released next month.</p>

<p>We've been toying with the idea of making an audiobook for the story, and asked <a href='https://pbat.ch/' target='_blank'>Paul B.</a> to use their voice synthesis tool <a href='https://pbat.ch/wiki/gesture/' target='_blank'>Gesture</a> to try and hear what <a href='https://merveilles.town/@patchlore/111042127852885392' target='_blank'>a poem in Ilken(Solresol)</a>(Mastodon) sounds like. The result was so lovely that it made Rek cry of joy.</p>

<p>Rek's <a href='https://merveilles.town/@rek/110934243447981216' target='_blank'>sketch thread</a>(Mastodon) is still going. Devine will be producing a lot more art next month for Drawtober!</p>

<h3>News</h3>

<p>Pino sailed a bit more northward this month and went all the way to the {octopus islands}. We visited this place during a very windy week, with winds blowing 30-35 kts the entire time. We got acquainted with a few northern rapids, like Hole in the Wall and Surge Narrows. It is a bit of a mindfuck to think that in these waters the tide ebbs north and floods south.</p>

<p>This summer has been especially arid, and because of it the province has seen a lot forest fires (see pictures of <a href='../site/sturt_bay.html#aug2023'>our smokey transit</a>). Trails that we know and love on Cortes Island, that are usually wet and muddy, were bone dry this year. We had a few days of hard rain, during that time we collect {rain} water and go for walks to  look for <a href='../site/hathayim_marine_park.html#jul2023'>slugs and snails</a>.</p>

<p>Both of us have been drawing a lot this month, see this <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/110982150120018215' target='_blank'>Neoneve portrait</a>(Mastodon) by Devine(drawn with <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/oekaki' target='_blank'>Oekaki</a>), and this <a href='https://merveilles.town/@rek/110934243447981216' target='_blank'>sketch thread</a>(Mastodon) by Rek.</p>

<p>We spent many quiet days in {Roscoe Bay}, and then wandered over to {melanie cove}(<a href='https://100r.co/site/melanie_cove.html#jul2023' target='_blank'>2023.07.18</a>) for a few days before moving to our favorite anchorage in Desolation Sound, {Hathayim Marine Park}(<a href='https://100r.co/site/melanie_cove.html#jul2023' target='_blank'>2023.07.09</a>). This inlet is quiet, and not overly busy, it is ideal for focusing on projects. We walk the 3 km trail to Squirrel Cove everyday. If we visit the same place multiple times, we like to append notes at the end of each page.</p>

<p>We have been hard at work reviewing {Wiktopher}, and we're happy to announce that we've finished the first pass of corrections! We'll be doing many more passes, but this was a very big step. Rek has been <a href='https://merveilles.town/@rek/110788283194637214' target='_blank'>drawing</a>(Mastodon) a lot, and Devine has been working on their presentation for <a href='https://thestrangeloop.com/2023/sessions.html' target='_blank'>Strange Loop 2023</a>.</p>

<h3>News</h3>

<p>Pino spent the first few days of the month on land, having its bottom re-painted, and its various bits serviced and checked. We took our propeller apart for the first time.</p>

<p>We've added a few write-ups of our travels so far (see above entry with links under 100r.co), but the most significant one is our 46nmi sail up to {princess louisa inlet}, a long fjord on British Columbia's Sunshine Coast, with an incredible gem at the end. It is an amazing, and unique place. We're glad we finally got to go. As we write this, we are in {Roscoe Bay} on West Redonda Island, tethering off a phone hoisted up the mast (it works quite well).</p>

<p>This summer we are {power} stable. We had issues last year because of parisitic draws due to old wiring (see {dc electrical refit}), but now everything is working as it should. We're charging our computers without an inverter, and that too is working out quite well so far (see {charging electronics}).</p>

<p>Together, Hikari and Lynn made <a href='https://github.com/lynn/chibicc' target='_blank'>chibicc-uxn</a>, a c compiler for Uxn, and with it also released a <a href='https://github.com/hikari-no-yume/oneko-uxn' target='_blank'>port</a> of the classic software <a href='https://social.noyu.me/@hikari/statuses/01H46X10WKDGC55ZZ3S4R5KA6X' target='_blank'>Neko</a>(xneko, oneko sakura).</p>

<p>{Oquonie} is out and it is playable! A big thank you to those who helped us test the game on a variety of devices and systems all the way to Windows95. This version of Oquonie differs a little from the original, in that some of the puzzles and secrets have changed. We hope that those who played the original will too enjoy this one. We have a special build of the game on <a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/oquonie' target='_blank'>itchio</a> with the emulator and rom combined, if you have a false-negative virus warning on Windows 10, you will need to use the standard uxn32 emulator and rom.</p>

<p>We have watched as people implemented <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn' target='_blank'>their own emulators</a> and were able to play Oquonie on a Varvara of their own making. The current <a href='http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/varvara.html' target='_blank'>implementation documentation</a> might need to be improved, if you have feedback for things that could be clearer, please let us know!</p>

<p>We published our experiments with {solar cooking} this month, and wrote a more detailed post on {solar evacuated tube cooking}. The real test will happen this summer. We plan to keep a log of everything we cook, how long it takes, and the conditions(sun, overcast, temp etc).</p>

<p>We're still closing a few projects aboard {Pino}, to get it ready for some summer sailing. Our plans for now are loose, we're hauling the boat out of the water in early June, with plans to sail back towards Desolation Sound afterward, with a possible stop by Jervis Inlet.</p>

<p>On February 14th, we celebrated our 7th year living aboard our beloved {Pino}. It's also around this time 10 years ago that we were still living in Odaiba(Japan), and beginning our work on what would be our first game collaboration: {Oquonie}.</p>

<p>The {uxn} port of Oquonie has advanced in incredible leaps this month. Rek has finished re-doing all of the assets. Devine is now working on the music, and finalizing some of the levels. We are testing the game as we go, and hope to release it sometime next month. Oquonie will be playable on a number of platforms, including the <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/109887931570318719' target='_blank'>Nintendo DS</a>(Mastodon), as well as the <a href='../media/content/stream/2023_oquonie.jpg' target='_blank'>Playdate</a>. See a small <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/109904081987266827' target='_blank'>preview</a>(Mastodon).</p>

<p>Early next month we are traveling to Galiano Island in the Salish Sea for <a href='https://activepassive.ca/index.html' target='_blank'>BioSonic</a>(by ActivePassive). We'll be part of an event series exploring the intersections of music, art and biodiversity. We'll give a talk on March 10th, and Devine will perform with {Orca} on the 11th at the Galiano South Hall.</p>

<p>This month, we started porting {Oquonie} to {Uxn}. This is a long time coming, but we weren't sure if it was possible to do, and we still had a lot to learn before even thinking of taking it on. Now, we think we are ready. We are <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/109753175335217737' target='_blank'>re-drawing the sprites</a>(Mastodon), and they look amazing. This is an important test for us, and for Uxn.</p>

<p>Here is a very adorable <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/109689586631044117' target='_blank'>little Uxn sprite</a> for Potato that comes up when a rom path was mistyped, see it also on the {uxn} page.</p>
