<p>In July 2025 we sailed to Ucluelet from the {Juan de Fuca Strait}. We gathered notes on several anchorages that we've stopped at on this page.</p>

<p><b>Bamfield</b>. On July 7th we sailed westward out of {Port San Juan} and towards the Broken Islands. The wind was light that morning, and the fog was thick and stayed thick throughout most of the passage. The fog bank only parted when we arrived at Pachina Point, and the northwest wind rose then too, permitting for a bit of sailing. Even if the wind wasn't high, conditions were a bit rough around Cape Beale. The water near the cape is shallow and reef-strewn. Before getting near it we noted that the sea was a beautiful jade color, making it easier to make out loose bits of seaweed(there were large patches floating around that we had to avoid). Conditions settled as we passed the cape, with the wind at our stern quarter. We anchored at the south end of Bamfield, in the first basin. There were 3 big power boats anchored, we found a spot amongst them but room was a bit limited due to the presence of many shore-side docks, a mooring ball, and a few crab pots. We anchored in 46 ft (HW) Our spot was well shielded from weather, we spent a quiet night there. We did not go ashore that day, but it looked like a nice small town to walk through. Cell reception in here was excellent.</p>
