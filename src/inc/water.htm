<p>It's easy to forget that water is not inexhaustible when it flows so readily by the turn of the tap. Living on a boat certainly helps to develop a deeper connection to this precious resource. Depending on where you are, you'll have to treat it, catch it, carry it or pay for it.</p>

<p>Basic needs are covered with a mere 10 liters of water a day per person. A person needs between 2.5 and 3.5 liters of drinking water each day. When anchored near a port, once a week, we would ferry four bins of 10 liters from shore to the boat. To conserve water, our sink faucet is operated with a foot pump, where each push draws out 60 ml of water, allowing us to measure our usage.</p>

<p>On passages, we carry extra Jerrycans of water, enough to sustain two people for a few more weeks than the length of our trip. Having separate bins makes for a more resilient system, if salt gets into one tank, it won't corrupt the entirety of your supplies. A sure way of preventing contamination, is to check all o-rings and tanks for leaks before leaving. We chose not to have a desalinator aboard Pino, and have managed well without it. It's a device that is expensive, high maintenance and power-hungry.</p>

<p>Our main water tank carries 170 L (45 US gal), our secondary has 50 L (13 US gal), while an additional 100 L (26 US gal) is stored in jerry cans.</p>

<p>In 2020, before the passage from Japan to Canada we replaced the holding tank with a water tank (see tank in below photo). We didn't have many options, but found a small water tank typically used in a lorry in Japan.</p>

<p>When it is not possible to dock at a marina, we use smaller(4x10L|4x2.6 US gallons) jerry cans to ferry water from shore. While it requires more trips, the lighter containers are less prone to breakage. When filling up, we filter the water.</p>

<p>Pino has no watermaker, and doesn't want one.</p>

<h2>Treating water</h2>

<p>The best method for distinfecting water is to <b>boil it</b> for <i>1 full minute</i>.</p>

<p>If boiling is not possible, it is necessary to filter the water prior to treating it with iodine or bleach.</p>

<h3>Filter</h3>

<p>Find a filter that is 1 micron absolute or smaller with a cyst rating of NSF 53 or 58 certification.</p>

<p>On the boat, to filter our water, we hook a twin set of filter housings in the line to purify the water. The 1st stage filter is pleated, and removes sediment, silt, dirt, rust, and other particles, and the 2nd stage carbon filter reduce the content of chlorine, concentration of toxic heavy metals, natural organic matter and oil products.</p>

<p>When we don't have access to pressured water, we filter the water by gravity (see our {gravity water filter}). We carry a pair of <b>black Berkey purification element filters</b>, a cost-effective way to remove chlorine (inc. chloramines), heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, VOCs, parasites, viruses, pathogenic bacteria, herbicides/pesticides, and hundreds of other contaminants from the water without removing the beneficial minerals, and without the use of any electricity.<br>Each element is designed to purify approximately 3,000 gallons of water before needing replacement, so they last a long, long time. We built our own filter holder, and strain contaminants in the water by gravity (a container over a bucket, with the purification elements in the top bucket, transfering clean water to the bottom bucket. Bottom bucket ought to have spigot).</p>

<p>In a bind, if you can't get a good filter to remove debris/impurities, run the water through a coffee filter. We like to put a funnel over a large container, and to line it with a coffee filter. The filter will eventually get saturated (especially if the water is dirty), and the flow of water will slow down, it may be necessary to replace the filter.</p>

We aimed for the most compact, and practical system possible, even if it isn't the cheapest.</p>

<h3>Bleach</h3>

<p>If the water is clear, the suggested ratio of chlorine to water is 2 drops bleach for 1.14 liters (1 quart). Use a dropper for more precision. The above ratios are for bleach containing 5.25% Sodium Hypochlorite. This amount depends on the concentration, the ratios will be different for 5.25% than for 8% chlorine bleach (1 drop: 1.14 l). Only use regular, unscented chlorine bleach products that are suitable for disinfection and sanitization, as indicated on the label. Allow the treated water to stand for 30 minutes. If there is a lingering chlorine smell and the water looks clear, it is safe to drink.</p>

<p>A good way to remember these ratios, is this saying:<br>
<i>“You must be 21 to drink.”</i></p>

<p>Things to remember:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use fresh liquid breach (less than 1 year old).</li>
    <li>Bleach doesn't remove chemical pollutants or disease-causing organisms (but in an emergency, if there is no way to boil it, it is better than nothing).</li>
    <li>Use a dropper for more precision when adding bleach.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the water is <b>cloudy</b>, add 4 drops of bleach per 1 L of water. Mix, and let it stand for 30 minutes. If after that time there is no chlorine smell, add 4 more drops and let it stand for an additional 30 minutes. If there is a lingering chlorine smell and the water looks clear, it is safe to drink.</p>

<p>It is possible to use purification tablets, but this may not be ideal if you need to treat a lot of water.</p>

<h3>Iodine</h3>

<p>Use liquid iodine(2%), or tablets, available in most drugstores. If using tablets, follow the directions on the package(Usually 2 tablets per liter of water.). Liquid iodine works best with 20˚C (68˚F) water.

<p><b>Treating water above 15˚C:</b> add 5 drops(0.25 ml) of iodine to 1 L of water. Mix both together, and let it stand for 30 minutes before drinking.</p>

<p><b>Treating water between 5˚C and 15˚C: </b> use the same ratios as warm water, but let it stand for 40 minutes before drinking.<p>

<p><b>Treating cloudy water:</b> add 10 drops(0.5 ml) of iodine to 1 L of water and let it stand for the times listed previously for both cold and warm water.</p>

<div class='notice'>Do not use iodine for more than 3 weeks(in controlled doses, following the instructions above) because there is a risk of thyroid problems and iodine sensitivity. Do not drink water disinfected with iodine if you are pregnant, have a thyroid problem, or if you are very sensitive to iodine.</div>
