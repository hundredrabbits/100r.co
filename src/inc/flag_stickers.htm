<p>An illustration of the phonetic alphabet featured on our project {rabbit waves}, drawn by Rek with ink and coloring pencils(see below photo of the original sketchbook drawing).</p>

<p>The illustrations are viewable on the <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/flags_maritime.html" target="_blank">International Maritime Flag Signals</a> page. Initially, we made flag stickers so we could stick one on our wall near our radio as a reminder, but we thought it might serve other boaters well too(or fans of the phonetic alphabet)!</p>

<p>Buying a sticker is a good way to support our work on Rabbit Waves, too!</p>
