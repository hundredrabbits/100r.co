<h3><a id='stickers'>Maritime flag stickers</a></h3>

<p>Inspired by the {rabbit waves} projects, more specifically the <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/flags_maritime.html" target="_blank">International Maritime Flag Signals</a> page. Initially, we made stickers of this so we could stick one on our wall, but we thought it might serve other boaters(of fans of the phonetic alphabet) too!</p>

<p>Buying a sticker is a good way to support our work on Rabbit Waves too.</p>
