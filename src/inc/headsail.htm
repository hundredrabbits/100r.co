<p>Pino's headsail is a 100% jib on a Harken roller furler. The jib has a protective dacron layer covering the leech.</p>

<p>On the passage from Ogasawara the cover of our jib started to tear. We bought material to replace it and stitched it on ourselves. Removing the old covering was a long, and tedious task.</p>

<p>Many ocean-sailors use sunbrella on their furling headsail, but it is a more expensive, and heavier material aloft, so we decided to keep using dacron.</p>

<p>Applying the new material wasn't hard, because it had a sticky-backing. We hand-stitched it at first using our sewing awl, but 3 days later we were still on panel #2 with the whole sail left to do. Our backs were aching, we feared we would not survive this project.</p>

<p>We asked Mr. Oka (the harbormaster) if he knew anyone with a sewing machine, and he did! We regretted not asking earlier. The sewing machine was at a loft, a 5 minute walk from the marina. The VOC(Vivre Ocean Club) used it to sew up sails for the sailing club boats.</p>

<p>Mr. Oka showed us how to use it, and off we went! We completed all the stitching in under an hour(!!!). All hail sewing machines—a very good invention indeed.</p>

<p>We had time to spare, so we worked on our Frankensail. We tried to do all of the work in the morning, because it got too hot there in the afternoon, even with all of the windows and doors open. Japanese summers are very, very hot.</p>

<h2>Frankensail</h2>

<p>Our friends Hiro and Kako from the sailboat Drifty gave us an old headsail that they kept at their house. The sail had a large tear at the bottom, but that was okay with us because we wanted to shorten it to turn it into a back-up sail. Our current jib looked fine, but we faced a long passage across the {north_pacific_ocean} and wanted to make sure that if something went wrong, that we'd have something else to work with.</p>

<p>We cut the torn panels out, and used it to double the material to make a thicker, stronger sail. We taped the layers with dacron sail repair tape first, so we knew what to affix, and where, and the machine took care of assembly. Well, we were there to feed the fabric through.</p>

<p>The Frankensail project was a success. We only flew it once during our passage from Japan to Victoria, raising it behind the headsail for fun. We're happy to report that our jib survived the trip. <b>Note:</b> <i>We had a new headsail made in 2026, and so we retired the Frankensail.</i></p>

<p>We are finally retiring our current headsail. It has flown for 23,559 nautical miles, likely more under Pino's previous owners. It has seen a lot of ocean, lots of wind and has visited 11 countries. Goodnight, dear sail, you will live again with us aboard {Pino} under a different shape.</p>

<p>In November 2025 we contacted <a href="https://www.leitchandmcbride.com" target="_blank">Leitch & McBride</a> in Sidney to ask for a new headsail to replace our current, weather-worn jib.</p>

<p>For the new headsail, we asked for a 110% jib, cross-cut, high-mod, 7.45 oz dacron, with a UV dacron leech and foot cover. We once again decided against Sunbrella, even if it lasts longer, we prefer the simplicity, look, and weight of UV dacron.</p>

<p>The new sail cost us 3642.24$CAD(tax included). This is not a cheap purchase, but this sail will last for a long, long time. Every other loft we contacted asked for much more than this. Pino's previous headsail was likely over 20 years old.</p>

<p>The sail was completed in February 13th 2026. To pick up the sail, we took the bus over to Sidney and our good friends Rik & Kay drove us to the loft. Paul Betts, the owner of Leitch and McBride is really great. If you need a new sail in the Pacific Northwest we highly recommend him and his team.</p>

<p>We raised the new sail to test the fit, then lowered it again to stow it inside the boat until summer. The less time it spends outside, the better.</p>

<p>We plan to keep part of the old sail to make new things, like a liner for Devine's backpack. It is comforting that part of the sail will continue to exist with us aboard Pino.</p>
