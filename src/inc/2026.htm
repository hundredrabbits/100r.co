<p>This is likely very obvious to most people, but recently it dawned on us that clothes are, in a certain way, open-source. We can go to a thrift store, buy a shirt, rip out the seams, study it, lay all of the pieces down over new fabric, trace the patterns, cut them out, and sew it all back together to produce a copy of that same shirt. We've been wanting to learn how to make our own clothes but didn't know where to begin, until this month. Our first project was to reproduce our hats, after the store we bought them at stopped stocking them. We bought black cotton canvas at a local fabric store, took our old hats apart and re-built them(See <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2026/01/11.html" target="_blank">Rek's hat</a>, and <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2026/01/17.html" target="_blank">Dev's hat</a>). Later, Devine did the same for our old <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/commuter_backpack.html" target="_blank">messenger backpack</a>.</p>

<p>Goblin Week, an event in which people draw goblins for 7 days, occurs on the last full week of January. Devine's <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/ghostly_chanting.html" target="_blank">entries</a> were inspired by a passage in Samuel Butler's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erewhon' target='_blank'>Erewhon</a>, and Rek drew some spunky cartoony <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/goblins.html#2026" target="_blank">goblins</a>.</p>

<p>Inspired by Prahou's <a href="https://img.triapul.cz/sect.html" target="_blank">Subversive.pics</a>, we put together image feeds for our personal websites.</p>

<p>We are making progress on the Playdate version of {Donsol}, and the polished manuscript for the {Victoria to Sitka Logbook}. We do not yet know when either will be finished so let us end this updated with one last small thing: a video by VacuumBeef of <a href="https://youtu.be/xYS3tytVll8?si=TjzLIvGvDLhSNaWy" target="_blank">Snake Game</a> in {Orca}.</p>
