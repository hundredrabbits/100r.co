<p>The passage from <b>Japan</b> (Shimoda) to <b>Canada</b> {Victoria} took <b>51 days</b>, and it was the hardest thing we've ever done. We decided to keep a logbook, to better remember it and so it can help others who wish to make this trip.</p>
<p>EDIT: The North Pacific Logbook was published in August 2020. In February 2021, we released <a href='busy_doing_nothing.html'>Busy Doing Nothing</a>, a revised and improved e-book version of this text (EPUB, mobi and PDF), then later that same year we released a <a href='https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/rekka-bellum-and-devine-lu-linvega/busy-doing-nothing/paperback/product-rqgmdj.html?page=1&pageSize=4' target='_blank'>paperback version</a>.</p>

    <td>We woke up early today, as we had little time to prepare before leaving Japan. Why so last minute? Because we only decided to leave yesterday morning. The reason we decided so late, was because we were waiting for a SIM card for our Iridium GO satellite phone, and we received it yesterday morning. As soon as we got it, we grabbed our passports and boat papers and hurried to the Immigration Office in Shizuoka to check out (a 4-5 hour train ride away). We were eager to leave on the 9th, as there was a good weather window, with moderate winds coming from a favourable direction. Because we weren't planning to leave until late yesterday morning, there were many tasks we had no yet done, or had not had time to do.<br /><br />We're usually more organized than this, with only a few menial tasks to do, but not this time. Last minute departures is not our style, but we also wanted to take this window. We had to find a post box to send the pocket wifi we rented and to fill our water tanks — this may not seem like much, but it was, as it piled up on top of other things we'd forgotten, like finding and installing the pot holders to the stovetop, installing the jack lines, taking out the tethers, putting key items back in the ditch bag plus a number of other last minute things that had escaped us at the time.</td>

    <td>We meet Shuhei, Thomas and Anja on the sailing vessel Robusta for coffee, turning down a cup as coffee, as it never sits right on the first day at sea. We use this opportunity to chat, meanwhile butterflies gather in my gut. I am nervous. I always am before a big trip and this time is no different, although this is our biggest passage yet, and will also likely be the most challenging. My gut has every right to twist itself into knots. We ask Shuhei to drop off our pocket wifi in a post box, he agrees— ah, what a kind person. He came by this with his truck to help Robusta with some last minute tasks, like getting produce, gas etc. We had done most of that ahead of time.</td>

    <td>We push off our spot and head over to the Shimoda Boat Services pontoon to fill our water tanks. We tied up to it and began to ferry bins back and forth to empty them in our tank. We filled as many recipients as we could carry, as we don't know how long the trip will take. Once the tanks and jerry cans were full, we left the pontoon and headed outside of the breakwater. The Shimoda coastguard ship was lifting anchor at the time, it went past us, disappearing quickly as it was going much faster. Outside of the breakwater, we saw the lighthouse on our starboard side, the one we had difficulty rounding when we arrived here a week and a half ago due to 30-knot winds off our bow. Today, the seas were tame and the skies clear and blue. <br/><br />We saw the Kurofune, a replica of Commodore Perry's black ship, taking tourists about the harbor. It was the first time we'd seen it on the water, as there weren't many tourists before due to concerns with the coronavirus. Now that the state of emergency's been lifted, people started traveling more around the country.</td>

The kuroshio, or <i>black current</i>, is very strong in this area, and even stronger between the islands as the water is forced through a narrow opening. We had no problem with ships, even with many heading to Tokyo. Our speed made it easy to work our way out of the main shipping channel. We are flying! Pino is happy to be moving again, and as are we.</td>

For lunch, we had inari pouches, a meal we'd purchased at MaxValue the night before. It's nice not having to cook on the first day. Neither of us are sea sick, but going below is still difficult and can easily trigger it. We stay outside instead, enjoying the good wind, weather and sun. <br /><br />Devine is reading "The mushrooom at the end of the world", while I steer us east. We tried calling Robusta on the VHF, but got no answer, either they're too far or their radio isn't on.</td>

We're experiencing the early symptoms of sea sickness, which usually means a headache, reduced appetite, morose view on things etc. This happens on every trip.

We have no appetite, but try to eat anyway.<br /><br />We ate raw snap peas as a snack, the texture was weird in our mouths. Devine made spicy ramen, which were very, very spicy. I couldn't finish my bowl. We had a grapefruit for desert, and made a mess on deck trying to pry it apart. The deck had red on it for a while afterwards.</td>

We are at 36 degrees, and it is worrisome as we knew it was safer to stay under 35. The wind above that line tends to be stronger. Robusta was at 33 degrees, upon exiting Shimoda they took a more southerly route, I wish we'd done the same. We underestimated the strength of this current. We have peanut butter toast with slices of banana on top for breakfast.<br /><br />Devine sent a happy birthday message to their sister.</td>

    <td>We watched seabirds pirouetting in the distance, they've no problem in this wind. Their movements are sharp and fast. We don't know what kind of bird they are, they're brown with a white stomach.<br /><br />We've noticed the automatic bilge pump keeps going off, we think there's a leak below the waterline, if so, that is worrisome. We tried to find where it was, but found nothing. None of the thru-hulls are leaking. I also checked the hose connections, nada! I suspect it may be the rudder post that is leaking, but for now it is impossible to look as I'd have to get into the cockpit locker, which is full of water bins and other heavy gear. For now, we try and check the bilge often, pumping the water out by hand every 2h or so. We have two manual bilge pumps, one in the cockpit and another in the cabin under the sink. The automatic bilge pump doesn't empty the bilge entirely, as it sits on a little stand above the lowest point, but the manual pump tube touches the bottom and does a better job of sucking up the majority of the water. If anything, the automatic pump serves as an alarm.</td>

We hang them over the sink so they drip into it, which makes doing the dishes a very complex and unpleasant affair. All synthetic clothing won't dry, and does a poor job of keeping us warm. We switch to wool as it stays warm even when damp.<br /><br />We still eat two small meals per day, but at least we aren't low on energy. The terrible weather has a way of keeping us focused, when there is danger we become superhuman, we need less sleep, less food...less everything. Don't know how long we can sustain this though...</td>

As the wind and waves were down, we spend time dealing with minor breakages aboard, like fixing leaks.<br /><br /><b>The anchor fell off the bow</b> this morning, after too much time spent bashing in the waves. This is bad. We could hear banging outside of the front of the boat, not because it was banging on the hull, but it was the sound of it hitting the water and reverberating up the chain. I went ahead to pull it back up, the bow diving deep. I was drenched with salt water. I managed to get it up, and secured it as well as I could. If the winds calm down enough, we'll take it off the bow entirely. If it comes off it could cause real damage to the hull.</td>

    <td>We added our main's 3rd reef in preparation for coming bad weather, it is easier to set it up in calm conditions. A main with a 3rd reef also flaps a lot less in light winds. We're lucky that none of our slides have broken off so far. In the last two trips we had many problems with this. While in Japan, I replaced our flimsy nylon slides with some of that same material, but with stainless steel inlaid. They are stronger, better quality overall. I know it is better for the slides to break rather than the main, but in our case, the main is very strong and won't split easily, also, replacing slides at sea is really, really hard and dangerous. I'd rather they not break. We both wish we had an outside track on the mast, the main would go up and down easily, and replacing slides would be easy. Ah, we can dream!</td>

    <td>Clear night, we can see the stars. I am bored tonight, my usual tricks to pass the time just aren't working, and so I do shadow puppetry using the light from the compass. We replaced the original light with an LED, but it shines so bright that it lights up the entire cockpit, acting as a stern light. We're going to have to replace this, as it is difficult to see the light of ships with it. I have to obscure it with my hand to see afar, not a big deal, but also not ideal.<br /><br />The 'usual tricks' I have to pass the time include brainstorming, as I have many ongoing projects to plan, I use night shifts to plan it all out in my head and take notes if the weather is good. Another, is recalling as best I can my favorite films, then wording them out. I've watched The Lion King too many times in my youth and can narrate it well enough, this can keep me busy for some time. I do the same for my favorite music, singing aloud when I feel tired to keep awake, and when I run out of ideas I try and do the same thing but translate the song into french, which usually makes me laugh and does a good job of keeping me alert. Listening to podcasts, music, or the audio ripped from films is something we used to do, but on this trip, we don't take devices outside as it is too cold, or too damp and will damage them.</td>

I say, but I always say that... even when I'm hurt. I try and get back to cutting things, but I feel faint, and have to go lie down before I fall again and really hurt myself. Devine asks me if I'm okay again, this time I say I'm not. Lying down did not help me, as the movement of the boat made it difficult to lay still. I wince with every passing wave. My ribs on my left-side are bruised, and I begin to worry... wondering if it would be hard to steer the boat in this condition. I couldn't let Devine do all the work, I just couldn't.

The wind is increasing now, and we make rice and veg for lunch. This is what I'd started preparing before I had my little accident.

    <td>Disaster. I was sitting outside, steering the boat as we ran in heavy weather. The waves were still monstrous, but showed signs of slowing. I noticed a large wave pushing up at our rear, the strength of it caused the entire hull to vibrate. Then, before I had time to look back, another wave came... I did not see it, but it overwhelmed me. <b>A giant wave broke over us and knocked Pino over</b>. I didn't see it happen, all I saw was a wall of water washing over me. I saw nothing but water. I was falling, the water dragged me off my feet... I remember thinking then: "Well, this is the end. This is how it happens." I wasn't afraid, or panicked, just disappointed? This is not how I wanted it to end.<br /><br />Then, the world became clear again, Pino righted itself and I found myself clinging onto the lower lifelines, hanging outside of the boat. I was tethered to the boat — thank goodness. My lifejacket had popped open too. I was dragging halfway into the water, coughing up salt water. I realized what had just happened then and screamed for Devine. I saw them work their way out of the companionway, completely shook up. <b>Our dodger was ripped off deck, in shreds, and the flexi panel on it was broken in half</b>.<br /><br />They ran for me and tried to heave me up, but couldn't. "Is something dragging you under???" They yelled, panicked. "NO!" I replied, "It's the weight of the water in my clothes! MY boots are full of water! Winch me up!" The winches and lines were covered in broken dodger pieces, it was hard to reach them. "TAKE MY LEG!" I yelled as I managed to lift my right leg up so he could help me get it above the lower life line. It worked. Once that leg was up, it gave me enough lift so they could grab my other leg and then it was easy to climb to safety. The boat was in a heave-to, because it had rounded a full 180 degrees. Devine secured it into a proper heave-to so we could assess the damage.<br /><br />We left the outside as it was and went inside. The cabin was a complete mess. "We're dead," Devine said. In truth, the inside of the boat looked worse than it was. During the knockdown, Devine was thrown from one bunk to another, the produce jumped out of the baskets, some of the floor boards were flipped over, a bottle of cooking oil lept out of the fridge and emptied its contents over a cushion and onto the floor, a giant jar of umeshuu leapt out of the same space and hit the ceiling on the opposite side, exploding onto the navigation table and instruments... all our charts were wet, our passports too. I usually stash them in dry bags, but I didn't do it this time and I'm not sure why? There was umeshuu EVERYWHERE. The stink of it covered everything.<br /><br />We sat on the sticky, wet floor, wide-eyed and shook up, thinking: "Did that just happen?" I downed a can of ginger ale. "You almost lost me," I said to Devine, pained at the thought. They came over and we stayed in each other's arms, for what felt like...forever. They smiled and looked at me afterward. "You want to get married?" I laughed out loud when they said this, grinning. "Yea. Fuck it. Let's do it." I said. We made a promise then, that if we made it back home to Canada, alive, that we'd get married and that we'd try and be content with less. We don't need to cross an ocean to be happy, surely?</td>

"The pilot isn't going to land on the ocean! The plane won't parachute us down either!" I say. Devine starts thinking it over, then realizes what we've done. We cannot return to Pino.

Rest plenty before the wind comes back.<br /><br />Sometimes though, I grow tired of resting. I am restless to sail, to move forward. I continue to watch the sea for ripples, but it is as still as ever. It is hard to distinguish the water from the sky, it is dizzying. It is almost as if there is air underneath us. If I were to take a step out, I'd fall, not sink. Devine is sitting at the bow, playing the harmonica, providing a fitting soundtrack. We try and make the best out of difficult situations, conserving food, water, resting our bodies and minds, and being careful not to succumb to the gloom bug. We must never despair.</td>

        <td>The wind has been erratic, coming and going, always from the N, or the NE. At times, it was so weak we could go neither E or N. Other times, the same strength permitted us to sail into it? Both of us are confused. The seas are also messy. Pino is sailing, but we're getting slapped by wavelets from the S, W and E? The westerly swell is notably bigger. The fog is here again, and it is thick. I can see the sun still, a diffused ring of light perched up above. We're happy to be moving forward but being outside is uncomfortable, the fog leaves droplets of moisture all over Pino, and us if we happen to venture into the cockpit. 10 minutes out there and my eyelashes have wet beads in them, and my foul weather gear becomes thoroughly damp and heavy.<br /><br />This morning at 1h, when I went to sleep, I noticed that I could see my own breath. Yep, it is cold in here! I was lying in bed, in a pile of sleeping bags, buried within to try and shield myself from it.
            <img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_15.jpg' / loading='lazy'> Devine made a lantern our of a can of Yebisu yesterday, they hung it up and placed a candle in it. It helped us save power at night, while giving the room a nice ambiance. If we near our hands to it it gives off a bit of warmth too, it feels good after a cold shift.<br /><br />Our next milestone lies ahead, 90 NM away. We'll hit the 2000 NM to Vancouver Island. It's a lot of ground to cover, but we've already done so much. If the wind stays we'll meet our goal soon enough, but it is difficult in these waters, where the wind is far from constant. We still don't have weather, as the Iridium office is closed on weekends, and that the next working day is a holiday. Sigh. We'd like to know what's going on out there, we can't read the waves and wind like Moitessier — at least not yet. Maybe it's time to unbox the sextant, although I imagine it wouldn't be easy to take noonsights in fog.</td>

Devine started up the engine for 1 hour, motoring N to try and find wind. Nada! The gloom bug is back, we're doing our best to fight it off. I took a angry nap, but it did little to freshen my mood. Everytime we get wind I think: "This is the wind that will take us home!" It is silly to think such things, for a reliable breeze in an area outside of the trade wind belt. Our GRIB files are more than 60 hours old, not a good reference anymore for what's happening out there. We thought we could use it to approximate the conditions, but in an area of supposed 'fresh winds', we've got nothing. Pino is still, as if it's forgotten what sailing is, it just might, with all of the calms we've been having. I'm beginning to forget what progress feels like.<br /><br />In better news, my ribs are better. I can sleep in almost any position, but I must be careful not to strain. Lifting heavy objects is still hard, and on some rare occasions I get a dull pain. All in all, it's better than it was and I am glad. Now, we await wind, if it would be so kind as to return to instill a bit of hope in us, some faith in the possibility of making it to land... someday. I often joke that Pino is a log, when we're not going forward. In such times, I feel the log would get to its destination faster. Maybe Pino is just tired? Steering us from calm to calm to rest its rigging and wings. We pushed you hard these past 4 1/2 years, haven't we?<img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_17.jpg' / loading='lazy'></td>

But no, it doesn't know this, and neither do we because we still can't get GRIB files. "Motoring won't help," I say, Devine finally agrees and turns it off. I take their place then, steering into nothing. Devine appears high-strung, annoyed, and they start digging through the cockpit locker to get to our old dinghy oars. They find them and elongates one of the two using a boat hook and some hose clamps. They takes it to the side of the boat and started rowing...! What I said about rowing Pino earlier has happened, but as you can expect, it did little to propel us onward, especially with one side doing the work and because the oars are too small and not really, very good ones. The paddle is too small. I urge Devine to stop, to go to bed, as I can tell they are frustrated. When Devine loses their cool, then you know that things are bad, but also, they have a headache again and I blame this for the momentary breakdown. "Go to bed," I say again.

Everytime we use them, we put them back into their box afterward to protect them. We've also added a pack of dessicant to minimize moisture.

I am inside, wrapped in a blanket, and gaze outside every 20 min or so, the time it takes for a ship to catch up. I also check AIS often. I look at Navionics too, although there is little point in checking our progress every hour, it is better to check after the day is past. We measure our advancements from 9h-21h, as 9h was the time we departed from Shimoda. It is strange to think that we were in Japan, that we made it, had a lovely time there, and left.

A small plastic boat sailing around the Pacific.<br /><br />I'd rather be here than on a plane though, that much is sure, as I hate to be bombarded with advertisements. Visiting an airport is an attack on the senses, a place of masterful trickery, where you are made to walk through rows of gifts shops, perfume stands, jewelers... the only way to have peace and quiet is to go to a paid lounge. Quiet and comfort comes with a price tag. It's crazy to think that people thought it a good idea to do this, who would design such a space? Such a world centered not on the well-being of people, but on how much money they can get them to spend. It is like this was designed by beings who've no idea what humans need, by creatures who have no empathy. That episode of Black Mirror where people run on treadmills for money, and pay not to see ads in their rooms, feels all too true while in airports.</td>

I missed seeing it, but more than this... it is such a relief to see the world and ocean with such precision, clarity and colour!<br /><br />Devine is making garlic, nori and chili flake pasta for dinner - one of my favourite recipes! We're using up our last onion, and the bulb of garlic is thinning out. These ingredients usually go last, but the potatoes are still plentiful. Staples in Canada, like carrots, onions and potatoes, are things that are cheap and easy to buy in large quantities — but not in Japan. Yellow onions were sold in packs of 3, and were expensive. The carrots too, sold in 3's, expensive. Why 3?! It's possible that the price of a big bag would deter Japanese buyers, as in general, produce there is costly, but still. When stocking up for this trip, we told Robusta the number of onions we got and they were shocked, because they'd seen the price at the market. We had little choice, since we don't have a fridge and that we had to buy many more long-lasting items to make up for it. At least, Japanese groceries stock many great items like dried tofu, kiri mochi, fu, preserved lotus root, dried seaweed, dried mushrooms etc.</td>

There's no way to know what you'll get when it comes to canned food. Canned brussel sprouts in Tahiti were amazing, asparagus in NZ were disgusting, but potatoes were good! It's a good idea to buy cans ahead of time to taste them, so as to no buy too much of the kind you realize you hate, and more of the good kind. Wish we had purchased more of those canned brussel sprouts.

        <td>Time for another freak out moment! I was steering outside, waves were okay, manageable, than overtime there would come trains of waves, sweeping in 3's, each one larger than the next. This is common on the ocean, but I was also getting cross waves. While I steered through the train of 3's, another set would come and hit Pino on the side. I freaked out because of the size and ferocity of the crosswaves, with some peaking way high, above the lifeline "This is it, not again..." My legs are noodles. J'ai des jambes en nouilles. I was so scared they could barely hold me up. I wanted to heave-to then, but I had to wait for the 3's to pass. Once they did pass, I parked Pino and hurried inside, finding Devine reading quietly on the starboard side settee. "You okay?" they asked me. When I park the boat, it is usually because things aren't okay. I went to lie next to them and shook for hours as they tried to calm me. Devine decided to try and steer, and did so for a while but stopped as the crosswaves were too much, even for them.

We are at a wall, with big weather all around, and ahead. These walls are, for the moment, impassable, keeping us and our destination apart. The Turn Off lies ahead, but a patch of very strong winds bars the way, reaching far N and S. We'll check the weather tomorrow morning, to decide if we should go, or wait. It's possible the weather will lessen, but it can also get worst.<br /><br />This streak of rough weather is a cruel, cruel thing, a horrible weather monster, guarding the east, keeping small ships from passing. Vancouver Island is concealed behind it, uncaring. "What can we do to appease you? OH great streak?" It doesn't answer, well, it answers the only way it can I suppose, with lashes of rain and gusts of wind. Maybe it intends to let us through, and we are misunderstanding each other? As different sorts of beings often do, being dissimilar in every way.<br /><br />I am eager, scared to see how this develops. 40 knots of wind isn't a big deal for most vessels, and it isn't for us either, technically, but it can get dangerous if the wind blows that strongly for hours and hours, then the sea has plenty of time and inertia to grow into something terrible.

One option is to keep heaving-to, but this will push us deeper into the system. Our boat might be fine, we might also get battered — no way to know. Another option, is to head a few degrees N, where it will be a tad calmer, but the winds there will switch to the E and there's a chance we'll get sucked back in. There's a calm forming N of that area that we can sneak into, but we fear the waves generated by the system that will enter that area, heaving-to in a calm is impossible, and we'd have to take the sails down and do the mad pendulum dance.<br /><br />Nothing is guaranteed, neither the calm, nor strength of that system. Conditions change daily, mostly in small ways, but also in big menacing ones. Today, we got the big menacing kind of update. I am tired of being afraid, of waiting, I'm tired of these walls that keep forming around us. The next 4 days will not grant us much progress, we'll be hiding from the monster streak, waiting for its anger to subside so that we can transit past it.

It is best not to count detours.<br /><br />I'm in a better mood than yesterday, as we've got a plan. Having a plan feels better than idling, waiting for the storm to come.

Steering outside is nice when the waves are down, we glide without resistance, pushing through the waves noiselessly.<br /><br />It isn't raining, so I take this rare opportunity to fill up the diesel tank. Operation fill-up was a success, with no freak wave slashing up onto the deck. I can fill the tank myself, thanks to a little syphon we got while in New Zealand. I tie the diesel bin on the cabin-top rail, so it stands a bit higher, than I jiggle the syphon and have it empty into the tank through a funnel with a fine mesh strainer. No mess, no problem.<br /><br />We are considering stopping at Ucluelet if we get low on fuel, but I don't think it'll be necessary. Landing there would shorten our trip though, that is something to consider, say, if we are tired. I've already marked the positions of the customs and fuel dock on Navionics. The little marina there looks nice, going there is tempting, but I wonder what the situation is now for Coronavirus as we've been in the dark for 37 days. WOW. 37?! That's long.

Keeping the space filled with words leave little room for anxiety to take root.<br /><br />Today, I re-packed our ditch bag, the current bag grew a bit of mold as it lay under the space where we'd hang our wet clothes. I pulled out what I thought to be a large dry bag, thought it would serve as a good replacement. I rolled it out once to look at it, but never tried to pack anything into it, I'd noticed then how long it was and thought it would be perfect for this. I assumed it had as much girth as it had length — far from! I put two big items in, and noticed how narrow it was, and so instead of bulging outward it grew skyward.

<td>Beautiful sailing today, so far! The wind is coming out of the N, Pino is self-steering to the NE in direction of Vancouver Island. The sky is blue in part, but as before... it is cold! I doubled up my leggings with another pair I found, and slipped on another sweater for a total of 3, plus scarf and tuque. It is always cooler inside the boat, as it retains much humidity.<br /><br />Devine is taking notes on their computer, while I've just awoken from a post-coffee nap. We're going to prepare lunch soon! We're in the habit of always discussing what we'll be cooking while having coffee, we look at the state of our ingredients and plan based on that. We still have plenty of canned kimchi, a few cans of corn, 1 of potato and plenty of beans. We still have a jar of dried radish, which I'm really thankful for! It was a gift from Kako. The daikon adds variety and texture to our meals. I found one full bag of kiri mochi too! A nice surprise as I thought we'd finished them all. Our supplies have definitely dwindled, but did so at a reasonable pace, same for or 5 kg propane tank and for our water. We've got another full 5 kg propane tank left, plus 30 L extra water in jerry cans, along with whatever is left in the main tank.<br /><br />We've been lighting candles at night, to keep the inside of the cabin lit while not disturbing whoever is asleep. We've gone through most of our collection, but still have 1 long one, which we'll use up tonight, and 3 little ones that only last 3 hours each. We need more candles aboard, the lighting is soothing, pleasant, and uses no power. Devine found a clever way to set up the tall ones, in a way that they won't fall over. They sit on a plate on the gimbled stove, secured by two pot holders.</td>

    <td>Devine prepared all meals today, with lunch consisting of one-pot pasta, cooked in very little water with all of the ingredients mixed in (chilies, soy bits, olive oil, garlic). The water and flavour is absorbed by the noodles, there is no waste and it's very, very good, especially if topped by shredded nori. Dinner was a stir-fried rice dish with kimchi, soft tofu and corn. We finished the last of the chocolate cake too.<br /><br />Today was very quiet, with Devine doing a lot of writing and reading, and me drawing, keeping watch outside and sleeping. I was very sleepy today, so sleepy I nearly fell asleep while steering from the companionway stairs. I took 2 naps, on top of the 5 hours I get per night. I think the reason I may be tired is because we've been shifting hours around, delaying the time our night watches start as the night is coming earlier and earlier as we go east. Days of calm also mess up our sleeping schedule, as we don't adhere to strict rules, we sleep whenever. My body demands a steady sleeping schedule to function, something that is hard to come by on a passage. We're looking forward to sleeping a full night together in the same bunk, it's been too long, I crave both the rest and companionship.<br /><br />Tonight promises winds of 10-15 knots, smooth, easy sailing. We made it under 500 NM, now THAT is exciting! We've got maybe 4 1/2 days left, if the wind holds! We finally switched away from Japan time to Vancouver time, now hours of the day feel more normal.</td>

<td>The trip's accumulated tiredness has pounced on me, its kicked me in the head and left me writhing on the ground in a pool of patheticness. Its attack triggered many, many emotions.<br /><br />It started with me outside in the cockpit, Pino was running downwind, and I was trying to pull in the main after gybing accidentally. Gybing scares me, as I am afraid of breaking something, this event already caused me some stress. I set our course back, then I pulled in the main sheet because I wanted to fix a block that was twisted under the preventer line. While pulling, the boat heeled because of a wave and I slipped on a rope lying on the cockpit floor. I fell, and hit my ribs on the edge of the seat. I now had a bruise matching the one on my left side. It hurt like hell. I just started cursing. I was angry. Then, that anger turned to tears and I just started to cry. I was just so fucking tired, of it ALL. My fall, and the morning's difficulties tipped the boiling pot of water that was my brain.<br /><br />"You okay?" Devine said as they came out to see me, sitting on the cockpit floor. "What happened? What's wrong?" I just pointed to everything. Yep, I was spent. The vase had tipped, the patience meter was empty, the gloom bug pricked me and the tears came and would not stop. Devine to the rescue. They knew what was wrong, really, it wasn't the pain, it was everything. Our callused hands, our swollen fingers, our bruises, the lack of sleep, our hunger, our impatience and eagerness to arrive... everything. They felt these things too. They dug out the Chromebook and found movies for us to watch, to distract ourselves from the repetitive tasks we'd been performing these past 46 days. They always knows what to do to calm me, to make me feel better.<br /><br />That's all I have to say for today, as my brain is mush and I haven't got the energy. Today is a day of rest.</td>

<td>Passed a lighted buoy to the north, been a while since we've crossed structures that aren't other ships. Steering was hard at times, last night the wind gave us forwardness, which we need, but it was hard on the hands. Downwind sailing requires a lot of focus too, making it even harder. Devine is in the habit of making miso soup during their night shifts, for warmth and to calm their stomach. I still rely on small slices of Clif Bars, it gives me enough energy to go through 3 hours of steering in the dark.</td>

We are lizard people in need of sun. They woke up around 9h30, and was happy to announce that they'd already pre-ground the beans and that the coffee would find its way to me sooner. YES. I'd already downloaded the weather then, seeing more light winds in our future. We'll do our best to stay patient, but it is tough, as we are lying 310 away from the entrance buoy. So close! We've got fuel, but want to keep it. We have a small allowance to cross narrow calms and to charge our batteries.</td>

We take breaks to peek outside now and again, as the sky is freakin' gorgeous! The clouds are puffy and dark on the horizon, but there are none above us. We haven't had fog in a while, very glad for clear days of full visibility, it helps brighten our mood. Because the seas are calm, I decided to make a small batch of pitas.</td>

It's weird to stare ahead and to think that Vancouver Island is out there, that it'll appear on the horizon soon. It's okay to start thinking in 'whens' now, rather than in 'maybes' and 'ifs'. We are arriving. It's happening. Looking at our track is strange, I remember doing it but it is surreal. It's strange to have the past, present and future in focus.</td>

<td>Devine has been devouring books. They finished Dante's Purgatorio, Don Quixote and is now nearly done with One Straw Revolution. It is rare nowadays for us to have so many consecutive hours of 'no plans', 'no work' and 'no social obligations', it is too easy to go through books, but I also suspect that Devine is a fast reader. They spend their entire night shifts standing on the companionway stairs, kindle in hand, rope in the other. Their brain must be whirring hard because they ate two pitas last night.</td>

    <td>We have a foot pump in the galley, with a pedal pushing against the pump to draw out water. One of the two pegs securing the pedal to the pump broke yesterday, not an easy fix. We have a spare pedal, but the fitting requires removing both the intake and outake hoses, not very convenient. It is hard to do a good seal, as the hoses are old, and this late into the trip I don't want to risk losing any water due to leaks. I did a temporary fix, with a rope wrapping around the top of the pedal to a pipe running underneath it, this helps keep the broken peg down, and I also added tape pulling the pedal forward to even it out. It's working well, so far! Let's hope it holds.</td>

    <td>Afer coffee, comes soba. Devine prepares soba for lunch with wasabi and soy meat. We cook them in so little water that they absorb it all. It results in soba covered in a gooey secretion that soba masters would shame us for, but we're okay with it, it tastes delicious and there is no waste. Soba masters don't have to worry about water, we have a good excuse.<br /><br />We've got 210 NM left. We've awakened Calcifer so we could motor through a calm to get past 130 degrees, where the wind is scheduled to return. There is a mean system forming in the ocean a few days from now, and we don't want to be in it. We're done having storms chase us. It is nice today, with calm seas, a warm sun and clear skies. We're sitting outside, getting some Vitamin D while trying to picture the outline of Vancouver Island in the distance. At times at sea, we see cloud patterns on the horizon that look like land, like mountains. It is too easy to trick our brains into believing there's actual land there, it's easy to warp our sense of space. We haven't seen land in 47 days, maybe it's easy to do because our brains long for the sight of land, for the shadows of great snowy peaks rising in the east. Soon, soon. In the meantime, we've got to watch for traffic. The Juan de Fuca Strait is a busy sea way, though after navigating the east coast of Japan I can't say I'm too worried, instead of 100 targets we'll get 20 and that is fine.</td>

    <td>We reached 130 degrees and put Calcifer to sleep around 1600. A bank of fog rolled in, and right back out, we're glad it didn't decide to stick around as we are really enjoying the fair weather we've been having, it's like being fully awake. Fog dulls your senses. The wind is returning gradually, we are cruising along slowly. It is easy to sail on little wind when there are no waves. Wavelets are the best. Cruising at 4 knots with a full jib and double-reefed main. We don't have to keep it reefed but at this point in the trip we are lazy, and besides, our speed is good. We've got 180 NM left! Soon we'll be aligned with the top of Vancouver Island!!!<br /><br />We are watching The Incredibles 2 this evening, with some popcorn! A little treat is nice every now and then. We're going to watch it until our night shifts behind at 21 h. Things should be smooth tonight, here's hoping we make good speed and get there fast.</td>

    <td>Realized that the GRIB files I downloaded yesterday were lower resolution weather, and did not rightly show the severity and extent of the weather running along the coast of BC. Upon seeing the detailed forecast this morning, we triple-reefed the main and braced for impact. The weather was horrible. We got huge waves, lots of wind and thick, thick fog. I was very discouraged, disheartened with what lay between us and our goal, yet another monster on the ocean, one my body and mind were just not up to facing. We were both sad, and angry for a while. We sat inside wishing it'd all end now. <b>Then a group of dolphins appeared in the fog</b>. A large group! Devine saw them swimming around the boat, they kept us company for a long while. We could hear them chatting through the hull, like several squeaky toys were being squeezed underwater. Everytime I heard a squeak it made me smile, it made us feel better and gave us the courage to push on. Thank you dolphins for being there with us, as always.</td>

It broadcasts no position on AIS, we can see its front sticking out of the water, making it seem like there's a little building moving on the surface. The wake further back is from another bit of the submarine, peeking out of the water near the stern. We couldn't believe it... a submarine?! We wondered where it came from, if it was American or Canadian, and wondered where it was going, and why?<br /><br />Meanwhile, a jet traces line in the sky, a whale-watching boat zooms around us, making our AIS go crazy, there are little fishing boats bobbing around near the Swiftsure Bank too.

<td>The wind has increased a lot, we ran at 6 knots under a reefed main all evening, but as we neared Sooke <b>the current turned against us, in strength!</b> To go forward, we had to use the iron wind. Calcifer helped us go forward, at a snail's pace. We had trouble making it around the Race Rocks lighthouse. Its light lay ahead, and we weren't getting past it. Devine was steering outside, and I was in the doorway, telling them to go south or north, zigzagging to work our way east as going straight on was not possible with this current. I was directing them because we had a very narrow corridor to work with, with Race Rocks to the north, and a busy shipping channel lane to the south. I had me eyes on both Navionics and AIS. As we lay south of the lighthouse, 5 cargo ships were moving in the lane south of us, back to back to back. I couldn't believe the timing of it. If no one had been there, we could have used that space, to tack out to avoid the worst of the current which is stronger near the lighthouse. This wasn't an option tonight.<br /><br />Because of the difficult conditions and our imminent arrival, we both skipped sleep, knowing we'd be in a harbour soon and could rest then.</td>

Pino suffered no damage that we could see, but the sound was frightening! We came upon a third log, but managed to avoid it.

    <td>We finally arrived at the entrance, tired and tired. Though the sun rising illuminated the mountains on the American side of the Strait, their bottom obscured by a long fog train, thick and going far east and west. It looked like a long marshmallow, floating over the water. We worked our way past the breakwater and into calmer waters, following the yellow buoys into the entrance channel. I furled the jib and lowered the main, and began running around deck, looking for our fenders and dock lines, things I am not certain I could get out in time as they were buried deep. Devine motored slowly to give me time to do everything. I never get a good first look at the new harbours we visit, because I am always running around deck, setting up lines, lowering sails, fastening items to other items, talking to authorities on VHF...<br /><br />We worked our way over to the customs dock, tied to it, without any drama, and we took our first steps on land... well, on a thing that wasn't our boat, as a floating pier isn't technically 'land'. It was a heavy concrete pier, and was very still compared to our boat. My steps felt heavy, like I had rocks in my boots, or as if the ground was pushing up against my feet. Devine stepped off then too, "feels SO weird!" they said, stumbling, while pulling the stern line in. We tied Pino up, jelly-legged on the pier, smirking like idiots. "MADE IT!" we said, throwing our arms up. It was finally okay for us to say this, nothing could take it away, no log in the water, no storm, no nothing.<br /><br />We both took a few steps back to look at our Pino, the vessel that carried us so far, so safely. It looked a bit sad without a dodger. We noticed the front of the bow was covered in green slime, and the stern had a few goose-neck barnacles stuck to it. Pino has looked better, and will look better again soon.</td>

    <td>I called the Canadian Border Control from a phone on the dock, giving them details of our arrival and trip. "Where are you coming from today?" they asked. "Japan" I reply. "Washington?" they ask, "No, no, Japan." I say again. "Oh...OH! That's a lot further." I laugh. "Yes, yes it is." Two officers came to clear us in person afterwards. We were excited to talk to people, other people! We talked their ears off, asking questions, making jokes, being overly-excited and overly-eager to talk about things, to talk about well, anything! We showed them our moldy passports, they laughed, saying they'd seen worst. We didn't know what to expect coming here. They told us there weren't too many coronavirus cases here, but that <b>we had to self-isolate for 14 days</b> before setting foot on land. I expected it, but wondered why it was necessary since we'd already spent 50 days away from everyone and everything. They told us it was a blanket rule, gave us masks, and off they went!<br /><br />The hard part now, was finding a place to quarantine from, as they told us most marinas don't want to do it to protect their customers. We called the Victoria Harbour Authority to get their advice, as we couldn't go directly at anchor since we had little water and almost no food left. One of the workers made a few calls and found us a secluded spot on a private finger, near the Johnson street bridge. She explained to me where it was on the radio, but by then I was tired, and not entirely familiar with the area. I understood nothing. I asked her to repeat, and as she was saying it... "Break break! Hey I can take you there!" Tim, on a harbour patrol boat called in, we could see him cruising around the harbour. He pulled up to the dock, grinning, and told us to follow him. What a friendly, friendly guy! We waited for a float plane to land, and then followed him to what would be our home for the next 14 days, a spot between a tugboat, and an empty finger for float planes.<br /><br />We couldn't go on land, but at least others had access to us! From here, it would be possible to get food, water, to wash our clothes etc. At this point, we didn't know how we'd be getting groceries, as most of our friends are in North Saanich, and we weren't sure if we could get a good WIFI signal. A gate separates us from the real world, we can see people, we can hear them too, but cannot take part in land life, not yet. It's nice to be here though, to know that we are finally safe, that we can cook without having to hold onto anything, that overnight sailing is a thing of the past, that we can sleep at the same time, in the same bed... that the storms are out there, what a feeling! We have flocks of geese flying over our heads, float planes too, there are water taxis zooming back and forth, carrying passengers from one shore to the other, we see people in cafes, chatting and eating, teenagers sitting in the park, laughing. At night, the Empress hotel is lit up, the harbour is bright, and even late at night we hear people talking. It's strange, all of it. Strange, but good. We are glad for the noise.<br /><br />We look at each other, sitting on deck and admiring the view. "Hey..." I say to Devine, "I'm proud of you!" Devine smirks, "I'm proud of YOU!" We look at the Delta hotel across the water. "I guess the french fries and cold beer will have to wait huh?" Devine nods, "Yep, the bath too." We go to sleep that night, dirty, tired, but happy. We're here. <b>HOLY CRAP we're here...!</b><img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_22.jpg' / loading='lazy'></td>

<h2><a id='closingwords'>Closing Words</a></h2>
<p>If you ask us why we decided to go sailing, we don't think we could give you a straight answer. Even the authors of our sailing manuals cannot explain what might compel anyone to do it, even after being made aware of the many perils of an ocean. Why would anyone do something with a very real risk of not making it back to shore, and furthermore, for no obvious reward?</p>
<p>It seems unjustifiable, or at least masochistic, that a person would wilfully put themselves through potential misadventures for fame and curiosity alone, mountain climbers might echo these feelings although we don't know any with whom we can verify this. And so, perhaps we do these things in the name of freedom, freedom to practice direct experience (with all that entails. Discomfort, pain, hunger and so on), here we shall name this calling <b>to live deliberately</b>, using Thoreau's words.</p>
<h3>Living by proxies</h3>
<p>Smart devices to take away the pain of thinking deep thoughts, social things against the solitude, forever removing ourselves, in exchange for protectedness, for a complete thoughtless socialized inexistence.</p>
<p>A creeping numbness might be to blame for our own search of this direct experience, in the form of long distance sailing, to let ourselves feel cold so we could sense the subtler changes in the weather, to go hungry to appreciate simpler foods.</p>
<p>Similarly, one might begin to talk instead of watching talk-shows and to play instead of watching game shows — To value the entire spectrum of sensations as necessary members of the whole that is the deliberate existence, with its potential for failure, awkwardness, loneliness, harm and death included.</p>
<h3>To feel secure</h3>
<p>Convenience products will protect those living at odds with nature. Novel and fashionable horrors will be popularized to subvert anyone into docility, else new fears will be provided as obedience demands.</p>
<p>In the name of security, a modern citizen will be thoroughly handled. A modern civilisation will deem itself total as it finally does away with all inconveniences, vanquished the totality of the Unknowable, the Indifferent, the Unorganizeable, of Nature, by means of paving over it.</p>
<p>We have seen the non-participation to the throughput mechanisms of society labeled as escapism, but we look at it in reverse where one escapes by being apart from nature. An illusory sense of dominion and domestication of nature might make one think of it as a place where one can escape to, and this is re-enforced when seen through the lense of a synthetic protective layer of proxies and simulations, but the protective layer doesn't curve outward upon nature, but inward upon the individual. And that is absolute escapism.</p>
<p>We believe that one can use nature's indifference as a reminder of the actual fortitude of their being, to learn of one's own true capacity for resilience when communing with nature — Ideas altogether at odds with modern stories, or an invitation to be part of something.</p>
<p class='quote'>"Modern man requires more and more comfort both at home and in the car. Sailors, too, want more comfort in their cruisers, but comfort cannot be combined with simplicity. And when life is no longer simple, it loses both beauty and joy.</i>" — Sven Yrvind </p>
