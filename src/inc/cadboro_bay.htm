<p><b>Note</b>. What we refer to on this page as Cadboro Bay is the traditional, stolen, unceded land of the Songhees, Esquimalt Nations, the WSANEC First Nations, the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Walla Walla Tribes, as well as members of the Teâ€™mexw Treaty Association.</p>

<p>Cadboro Bay is a bay on the southeastern end of Victoria, it houses the Royal Victoria Yacht Club.</p>

<p>We stop here once in a while on our way north or south, from and to {Victoria}. There is a lot of current about the Discovery Islands, depending on the length of tide cycle and at which time we leave, we do not always have enough time to sail past it(we bypass it most times, if the currents and wind are right).</p>

<p>It is a purely utilitarian anchorage, the holding in mud is very good but there is not much protection. All the most protected spots are taken up by local moorings north of the Royal Victoria Yacht Club docks. We don't especially like stopping here because it is open to the south, and even if it is protected from prevailing westerlies out of the Juan de Fuca Strait waves will still come rolling in out of the south. We've often had situations where the boat themself is facing west, but the waves hit us broadside out of the southeast, making for a very uncomfortable time at anchor. It is worse when the westerlies stop because it takes a long while for the waves to also diminish to nothing.</p>

<p>In the summer the bay is often busy with sailing school boats. Organizers set a lot of buoys in the bay, restricting anchoring if you happen to arrive when they've already been set. They remove the buoys once the courses are finished (note that there are often multiple courses per day, afternoon and evening).</p>

<p>Cadboro Bay is most ideal in calm weather, but it is also fine in strong westerlies or north winds, even if it isn't comfortable. Avoid this anchorage in strong weather, especially southeast storms. Boats often end up on the shore here.</p>
