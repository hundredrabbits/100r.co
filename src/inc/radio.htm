<p>Onboard Pino we carry a fixed marine <abbr title="Very High Frequency">VHF</abbr> radio, a handheld VHF and two transceiver Walkie Talkie two-way radios. VHF/<abbr title="Ultra High Frequency">UHF</abbr> radio waves travel in straight lines (line-of-sight) generally cannot travel beyond the horizon. VHF (very high frequency) is the designation for the range of radio frequencies from 30 to 300 <abbr title="Megahertz">MHz</abbr></p>

<p>A marine VHF radio is an important and reliable for bidirectional voice communication both for ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore.

The handheld marine VHF has the same functionalities as the fixed version, but is equipped with <abbr title="Digital Select Calling">DSC</abbr>.</p>
