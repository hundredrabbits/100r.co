<p>Onboard Pino we carry a fixed marine VHF radio, a handheld VHF and two transceiver Walkie Talkie two-way radios. VHF/UHF radio waves travel in straight lines (line-of-sight) generally cannot travel beyond the horizon. VHF (very high frequency) is the designation for the range of radio frequencies from 30 to 300 megahertz (MHz)</p>

<p>A marine VHF radio is an important and reliable for bidirectional voice communication both for ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore. In Canada, a <b>Restricted Radiotelephone Operator Permit</b> is required to transmit, it is unlawful to operate a ship station that is not licensed. The handheld marine VHF has the same functionalities as the fixed version, but is equipped with DSC(Digital Select Calling).</p>

<p>We sometimes use the two transceiver two-way radios to talk to each other from shore-to-shore. Whether or not you need a radio licence depends mainly upon the type of radio equipment being used. In Canada, licence exemptions only apply to radio equipment that has been tested and certified to comply with specific technical standards, and operates in specially designated frequency bands. A license ensures that new users are aware of the existing regulations and don't broadcast on reserved frequencies.
