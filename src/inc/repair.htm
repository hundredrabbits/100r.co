<p>Every object we buy is a potential burden, in terms of the physical and mental space the item occupies. Even when it passes out of our hands, whether it is sold, passed down, donated or discarded, the object still exists, while many more are manufactured. In his book The Long Way, Moitessier talks about the need to stop satisfying false needs and false joys, to instead focus on preserving nature. Preserving nature is our most worthy responsibility, and isn't compatible with an economy of "full consumption".</p>

<p>We have contributed our share of waste in the past, we have burdened others with objects when we reduced our own lives to fit onto a boat. Now, we do our best to avoid new items, and spend time seeking existing alternatives, or repairing broken items whenever possible. It is a challenge, our for-profit economy doesn't encourage thrift and care, it promotes off-the-shelf solutions, while making repair and thrift difficult, and unattractive.</p>

<p>Time is necessary to practice thrift and care, but it is a scarce resource. Work takes an ever-larger chunk out of the average person's day. Time did not used to be compartmentalized into work and non-work, "work" was once more intertwined with family, community and play. Now, "work" pays for outside entertainment, and life outside of work has lost vitality and meaning, it has ceased being a means to an end and become an end in itself. An economy that glorifies "work" and "infinite consumption" preaches that leisure is a commodity that people can consume rather than it being free time that they can enjoy. Today's pleasures are debited to the future, paid not in money, but in waste and misery. A purchase that was easy to make today, will be an inconvenience to someone, somewhere, later. Our membership in this world is never free.</p>

<p>We have to cherish nature, to foster its renewal, and to prioritize thrift and care rather than waste and excess. Maintenance and stewardship require something of us, we have responsibilities that lie beyond ourselves and our own profit. The farming phrase, “eyes to acres,” by Wes Jackson, says that in order to run a farm well, one has to be familiar with the environment, to be in touch with the little changes that occur every day. Only when we see land as a community, to which we belong, can we begin to use it with respect and love. This was an excerpt from {Busy Doing Nothing}, which we thought was worth re-printing here.</p>

<q>The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land. Land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such.<br>— Aldo Leopold</q>

<h2>Repair, reuse.</h2>

<p>Doing maintenance and repairs yourself will bring the cost down. Offloading work to professionals if you can afford it is fine, but it's good to know how to take care of your boat. You may not always have access to workers if sailing to far-flung islands.</p>

<p>A failure to maintain items regularly will cost more later. We recommend keeping a log of the repairs, part replacements that is done to your boat. Many parts have a limited lifespan, so knowing when they were replaced last will help prevent breakages. If leaving for a big sailing trip with spares, <b>install the spare and keep the other one as the spare</b>. If you do this, you'll learn how to change the part and what tools you need to do the job.</p>

<p>When doing repairs, use quality materials and products, research them thoroughly before a project instead of relying on brand names.</p>
