<p>Our traveling studio has operated {off the grid} since 2016.</p>

<p>For the first 3 years we tested the limits of our space, and at first, it was difficult to create new things, as we had to make time to learn how to solve the underlying problems. Our boat was not just an office, it was also our house and transport. As for us, we were artists, but also had to be plumbers, deckhands, electricians, captains, janitors and accountants.</p>

<p>Our main problems as a studio were <b>internet scarcity</b>, <b>power management</b>, <b>data storage</b> as well as <b>hardware</b> and <b>software failures</b>. Overtime we found ways to balance work, pleasure and {maintenance}. Here are some of the lessons we learnt.</p>

<h2 id='power'>Power management</h2>

<p>Our work schedule is tied to the {weather}, as we depend on solar energy to power our computers. By looking at the forecast, we can determine when we will get the most work done: consecutive days of sun grant us enough {power} for video-editing, while overcast days are reserved for low-power work, like writing, coding and planning.</p>

<p>There are times when we must resort to secondary power sources, like our small generator or our engine's alternator, but we tend to prefer to <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ua_qxjbBTc'>wait for the sun to return</a>. Waiting hasn’t affected our productivity, as we don't adhere to strict 8-hour workdays.</p>

<p>We tend to work only in the morning, leaving us time to pursue other interests in the afternoon. In our old life, we found that the 40-hour workweek ﻿<a href='https://www.raptitude.com/2010/07/your-lifestyle-has-already-been-designed/' target='_blank'>kept free-time scarce</a>, resulting in us spending more for convenience, gratification and distraction.</p>

<p>Computers are generally power-sucking vampires. Choosing different software, operating systems, or working from machines with a lower draw (ARM) or even throttling the CPU, are some of the many things we do to lower our power requirements. The way that software is built has a substantial impact on the power consumption of a system, it is shocking how cpu-intensive modern programs can be.</p>

<p>Choosing software designed for low-end PCs is a good solution, it is also possible to throttle processes on your machine by using a ‘throttling controller’. The basic idea is like the throttle in a car, it allows to set the rate at which your system will operate and consume power. Another sure way to save battery is to limit multitasking. Disabling notifications, <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/noscript/'>scripts</a>, auto-playing videos or using internet browsers without opening multiple tabs at once are some of the many ways to achieve this.</p>

<p>Power consumption is also something to consider when choosing a computer. In the evenings, if we need to work on light tasks, we switch to our low-power machines like the {Raspberry Pi}. To illustrate the difference in power draw, a Pi4 uses 2.85 W when idle, while a Macbook Pro uses 6-12 W. Raspberry Pis are backups to our main computers, as they are inexpensive and can run off small batteries.</p>

<p>In the 60s, there was a group of French writers who would create works using constrained writing techniques, like replacing every noun in a text with the seventh noun after it in a dictionary. They did this to inspire ideas and creativity. Living and working aboard a sailboat was for us a constraint, it liberated our imagination by eliminating possibilities.</p>

<p>We work less, by keeping our needs small. We both cannot deal with working within rigid schedules, and we both know that we find our best selves when working close to nature.</p>

<p>The things we struggled with when setting up our studio, are also what taught us the most. Our frustrations with software resulted in us building our own. With limited internet, we became more independent. When hardware failed, we learned to fix them. Lacking power, we had to re-imagine our studio and projects, to calculate usage and optimize our setup to do more with less. It was a transformative experience for us, and it can be for you too if you try and work according to resources and the weather.</p>
