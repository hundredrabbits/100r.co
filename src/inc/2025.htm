<p>The weather is getting warmer, which is perfect for airing out {Pino}'s lockers, and drying off moldy clothes and tools. Anything stored in the v-berth lockers, below the waterline, suffer from extreme wetness. It is a very, very annoying fact of boat life, but there is really no way to bring good air flow in those spaces. We scrubbed the lockers clean, parted with items we no longer needed, and sent two laptops to the recycler.</p>

<p>In last month's update, we mentioned Flickjam, a game jam based on Increpare's <a href="https://www.flickgame.org/index.html" target="_blank">Flickgame</a>. We received a total of <a href="https://itch.io/jam/flickjam-2025/entries" target="_blank">27 entries</a>! They're really fun, and all playable in the browser. <a href="https://itch.io/jam/flickjam-2025/rate/3445250" target="_blank">Devine's jam entry</a> is about a very adorable rabbit learning to play the word "rabbit" on a xylophone in <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/solresol.html" target="_blank">Solresol</a>.</p>

<p>Devine spent some time off the computer, <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/skates.html" target="_blank">skating</a> and <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/paper_logic.html" target="_blank">folding paper</a>. The <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/paper_computer.html" target="_blank">paper computer</a> pages have been updated to cover some new ways in which computer emulators can be operated on paper. While on that subject, we highly recommend Tadashi Tokieda's excellent talk named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p02DtmyQhU" target="_blank">A world from a sheet of paper</a>.</p>

<p>Another item on Devine's list was to gradually phase out <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/etc/uxnasm.c.txt" target="_blank">Uxnasm.c</a> in favor of the <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/drifblim.html" target="_blank">self-hosted</a> assembler. We're not 100% pleased yet, but it is getting closer to retirement.</p>

<p>Starting on <b>May 20th 2025</b>(1000 PST/PDT) the <a href="https://play.date/games/" target="_blank">Playdate Catalogue</a> will include {Oquonie}. The game is also available on our <a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io store</a>.</p>

<p>The video for Devine's November 2024 talk <a href="../site/shining_sand.html">A Shining Place Built Upon The Sand</a> is now on <a href="https://youtu.be/EACF2VEpO3Q" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p>

<p><b>Book Club:</b> This month we are reading <i>Banvard's Folly</i> by Paul Collins, and still making progress on the <i>The Goldfinch</i> by Donna Tartt.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>100r.co</b>, added a new page called {ipad media station}. Updated the {Victoria to Sitka logbook} with the 2 final weeks: <a href='../site/victoria_to_sitka_logbook.html#week14'>Week 14</a> and <a href='../site/victoria_to_sitka_logbook.html#week15'>Week 15</a>.</li>
	<li><b>{rabbit waves}</b>, added 2 new pages: <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/first_aid_kit.html" target="_blank">First-Aid Kit</a> and <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/triangular_bandage.html" target="_blank">Triangular Bandages</a>, and updated <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/emergency_bag.html" target="_blank">Emergency Bag</a> with new illustrations.</li>

</ul>

<p>In the above illustration, {little Ninj} is going through a <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/first_aid_kit.html" target="_blank">first-aid kit</a>, looking through our supplies to see what needs to be topped off and what is out-of-date. Rek drew a list of suggestions on what to include in both a first-aid and a medical kit for the {Rabbit Waves} project, we plan to add more items soon(thanks to everyone on Mastodon who suggested additions! It'll be in the April update).</p>

<p>We will spend the first few days of April participating in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/flickjam-2025" target="_blank">Flickjam</a>, making small games in the style of <a href="https://www.flickgame.org/index.html" target="_blank">Flickgame</a>, a tool originally made by Increpare, in which the world is navigated by clicking on pixels of different colors to head in different directions. Devine ported <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/flick.html" target="_blank">Flickgame to Varvara</a>, and wrote a compiler for flick games to uxn roms.</p>

<p>This past month, Rek finished transcribing the entire 15 weeks of the {Victoria to Sitka logbook}! We have plans to turn it into a book, in the style of {Busy Doing Nothing}, with tons of extra content and illustrations.</p>

<p>March was a very good month for silly <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/03/31.html" target="_blank">calendar doodles</a>. Our paper calendar is always in view, it documents important events like releases, appointments, as well as food, memes, and other noteworthy things that happened on each day.</p>

<p><b>Book Club:</b> This month we are still reading <i>The Goldfinch</i> by Donna Tartt, it's a long book!</p>

</ul>

<p>On February 14th, we celebrated our 9th year living aboard our beloved {Pino}. Read a <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/fitness" target="_blank">short text</a> by Devine, which expands on what it means to truly be a generalist.</p>

<p>Despite the weather being less-than-ideal, we were able to <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/02/20.html" target="_blank">install</a> our replacement solar panels, and revisit our notes on {solar} installations.</p>

<p>Devine completed <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/nebu" target="_blank">Nebu</a>, a spritesheet editor as well as a <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/media/generic/calendar.png" target="_blank">desktop calendar</a>, alongside many other little <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/utilities.html" target="_blank">desktop utilities</a>. Nebu is just over 8.3 kB, a bit less than a blank excel file.</p>

<p>In times of increasing climate and political instability, it is a good time to get together with your community and make plans for emergencies. Consider reading <a href="https://archive.org/details/disaster-preparedness-tokyo" target="_blank">Tokyo Bosai</a> about disaster preparedness, this elaborate document deals with disasters that occur specifically in Japan, but many of the recommendations are useful regardless. We released a new page on {rabbit waves} with suggestions on what to pack in an <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/emergency_bag.html">Emergency Bag</a>. Remember, every emergency bag is different, and what is essential varies per person.</p>

<p>We also put together a print-it-yourself zine, which combines useful information about <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/morse.html" target="_blank">Morse Code and <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/flags_maritime.html" target="_blank">Signal Flags</a>. If you have printed the zine and don't know how to fold it, see Rek's <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/folding_zine.html" target="_blank">illustrated instructions</a>. Speaking of signal flags, we printed <a href="https://100r.co/site/flag_stickers.html" target="_blank">stickers</a> of Rek's ICS flag drawings.</p>

<p>The nice weather finally arrived this week and we were able to redo Teapot's <a href="../site/teapot_gelcoat.html">gelcoat</a>. This was our first time working with gelcoat, our friends Rik & Kay, who lent us their workspace, were very patient and generous teachers. We will continue the project later when the gelcoat has cured.</p>

<p><b>Book Club:</b> This month we are reading <i>The Goldfinch</i> by Donna Tartt.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>100r.co</b>, added a new page: {tote}. Added <a href='../site/victoria_to_sitka_logbook.html#week8'>Week 8</a> and <a href='../site/victoria_to_sitka_logbook.html#week9'>Week 9</a> of the {Victoria to Sitka logbook}.</li>

	<li><b>{Orca}</b>, added <a href="../site/orca.html#community">community links</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Devine spent time improving the html5 {uxn} emulator, and thanks to their hard work it is now possible to play {Niju}, {Donsol}, and {Oquonie} directly in the browser on itch.io, the same goes for {projects} like {Noodle} and {Tote}.</p>

<p>It's been a long time coming, but {Oquonie} is now playable on <a href="https://play.date/" target="_blank">Playdate</a>. Rek spent the last week converting the 2-bit assets for Oquonie to 1-bit, because some of the characters and tiles were too difficult to read, now all of the assets work perfectly on monochromatic screens. As an amazing plus, Devine got the music and sounds working perfectly, just like in the original iOS version.</p>

<p>From January 19-25th, we both participated in <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/goblinweek" target="_blank">Goblin Week</a>, an event in which you make goblins every day for a week(whatever that means to you). See the goblin series made by <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/01/25.html" target="_blank">Rek</a>(viewable <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/goblins.html" target="_blank">here</a> in higher rez also) and the one made by <a href="https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/113858664512777630" target="_blank">Devine</a>(Mastodon).</p>

<p>Pino has earned <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/01/23.html" target="_blank">two new replacement solar panels</a> this month! We have not installed them yet, it is still too cold outside in {Victoria} (we are expecting snow this week).</p>

<p>We share photos often in our monthly updates, and so Devine spent time building our very own <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/" target="_blank">custom photo feed</a> named <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/days" target="_blank">Days</a>. It is possible to follow the feed with RSS. </p>
