<p>On February 14th, we celebrated our 9th year living aboard our beloved {Pino}. Read a <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/fitness" target="_blank">short text</a> by Devine, which expands on what it means to truly be a generalist.</p>

<p>Despite the weather being less-than-ideal, we were able to <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/02/20.html" target="_blank">install</a> our replacement solar panels, and revisit our notes on {solar} installations.</p>

<p>Devine completed <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/nebu" target="_blank">Nebu</a>, a spritesheet editor as well as a <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/media/generic/calendar.png" target="_blank">desktop calendar</a>, alongside many other little <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/utilities.html" target="_blank">desktop utilities</a>. Nebu is just over 8.3 kB, a bit less than a blank excel file.</p>

<p>In times of increasing climate and political instability, it is a good time to get together with your community and make plans for emergencies. Consider reading <a href="https://archive.org/details/disaster-preparedness-tokyo" target="_blank">Tokyo Bosai</a> about disaster preparedness, this elaborate document deals with disasters that occur specifically in Japan, but many of the recommendations are useful regardless. We released a new page on {rabbit waves} with suggestions on what to pack in an <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/emergency_bag.html">Emergency Bag</a>. Remember, every emergency bag is different, and what is essential varies per person.</p>

<p>We also put together a print-it-yourself zine, which combines useful information about <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/morse.html" target="_blank">Morse Code and <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/flags_maritime.html" target="_blank">Signal Flags</a>. If you have printed the zine and don't know how to fold it, see Rek's <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/folding_zine.html" target="_blank">illustrated instructions</a>. Speaking of signal flags, we printed <a href="https://100r.co/site/flag_stickers.html" target="_blank">stickers</a> of Rek's ICS flag drawings.</p>

<p>The nice weather finally arrived this week and we were able to redo Teapot's <a href="../site/teapot_gelcoat.html">gelcoat</a>. This was our first time working with gelcoat, our friends Rik & Kay, who lent us their workspace, were very patient and generous teachers. We will continue the project later when the gelcoat has cured.</p>

<p><b>Book Club:</b> This month we are reading <i>The Goldfinch</i> by Donna Tartt.</p>

<p>Devine spent time improving the html5 {uxn} emulator, and thanks to their hard work it is now possible to play {Niju}, {Donsol}, and {Oquonie} directly in the browser on itch.io, the same goes for {projects} like {Noodle} and {Tote}.</p>

<p>It's been a long time coming, but {Oquonie} is now playable on <a href="https://play.date/" target="_blank">Playdate</a>. Rek spent the last week converting the 2-bit assets for Oquonie to 1-bit, because some of the characters and tiles were too difficult to read, now all of the assets work perfectly on monochromatic screens. As an amazing plus, Devine got the music and sounds working perfectly, just like in the original iOS version.</p>

<p>From January 19-25th, we both participated in <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/goblinweek" target="_blank">Goblin Week</a>, an event in which you make goblins every day for a week(whatever that means to you). See the goblin series made by <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/01/25.html" target="_blank">Rek</a>(viewable <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/goblins.html" target="_blank">here</a> in higher rez also) and the one made by <a href="https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/113858664512777630" target="_blank">Devine</a>(Mastodon).</p>

<p>Pino has earned <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/01/23.html" target="_blank">two new replacement solar panels</a> this month! We have not installed them yet, it is still too cold outside in {Victoria} (we are expecting snow this week).</p>

<p>We share photos often in our monthly updates, and so Devine spent time building our very own <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/" target="_blank">custom photo feed</a> named <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/days" target="_blank">Days</a>. It is possible to follow the feed with RSS. </p>

<p><b>Book Club:</b> This month we are reading <i>How do You Live?</i> by Genzaburo Yoshino and <i>Middlemarch</i> by George Eliot.</p>
