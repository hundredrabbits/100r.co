<p>The Juan de Fuca Strait is a 100 NM long channel that divides Canadian waters from US waters. A busy shipping channel snakes along the middle, with boats heading west taking the northmost lane. Despite the presence of a shipping channel, there is plenty of room to sail and maneuver around. There is a lot of water moving through the strait, timing movements with current is important, especially around Race Rocks and Sooke. We have sailed through the Juan de Fuca Strait a few times, east and west. We gathered notes on several anchorages that we've stopped at on this page.</p>

<h2>Becher Bay</h2>

<p>On July 4th on a calm morning at 0500, we left Cadboro Bay and made our way into Juan de Fuca Strait. 3 Canadian navy ships were patrolling the shore, doing back and forths from Esquimalt to Williamshead. At that point we had considered dropping the anchor in Quarantine Cove, but we instead decided to push on and snuck past a fog-engulfed Race Rocks. We went to anchor in Becher Bay just before a 30-35 knot westerly wind was supposed to start. We anchored east of Wolf Island in 13 ft(max of 16 ft HW), although we anchored a bit too close to the gap between the island and the Vancouver Island shore. The bay was calm when we arrived, but when the wind picked up it came funneling out of the gap, accelerated as it contours the top of Wolf Island. There was no one else anchored here, and no crab pots, so we have plenty of room to add scope to weather the passing gale. The ground had very good holding in mud, we set our anchor alarm and never once dragged, even when the wind whistled higher than 35 knots. The motion aboard was a bit distressing, it was difficult to sleep, but the boat was safe. Anchoring just a bit more south of the gap in the lee of Wolf Island seems like a very well-protected spot, although the waters are in the 30 ft range there, and it is not possible to tuck in close to the island because of a submarine cable. In all, this is a very good and safe spot, provided that you add enough scope. Anchoring here gives you a very clear idea of conditions out in the Strait, we could see the sea state from the cockpit through our binoculars.</p>

<h2>Port Renfrew(Port San Juan)</h2>

<p>On July 5th we sailed from Becher Bay to Port Renfrew. We left at 0500 and arrived at 0730. We left with a helpful current which permitted for some good windward progress, but the wind was still a bit strong that morning and so wind against current created some pretty gnarly waves. The waves lessened as we tacked into the wind and past Sooke. We considered stopping in Sooke if the waves did not diminish, but since they did we pushed on. Sailing into the wind greatly lenghtens time spent on the water, and so inevitably, later the tide turned and sailing to wind was much more difficult. By then the wind had lessened considerably too, so we motor sailed into the wind. Pino doesn't motor well into weak winds, but motor-aided sailing allows for decent progress. Eventually, the wind picked up again, permitting for more sailing, but died 10 NM away from Port Renfrew. We motored into the ever-lessening waves all the way to Thrasher Cove on the northwest side of the inlet. We arrived there at 0730, just as a fog bank that had been lingering along the northern shore of the anchorage dissipated. The weather outside of the south end of Vancouver Island was pretty calm that evening and the next morning, so there weren't many sea swells and little wind. All of Port San Juan is very open for anchoring. We tucked in near shore in Thrasher Cove, which is really more a sad indent in the land than a cove, and dropped anchor in 30 ft HW. There were a few crab traps, but not enough to restrict anchoring(we read that sometimes the cove is full of them, making it impossible to anchor). We saw many tents laid up ashore. The wind that evening did not reach us, but the boat rolled a bit with a swell coming out of the south. The next morning, the inlet was still calm, we lifted anchor at 0930 and headed to the dock at Pacific Gateway Marina. When we left a wind was building into the inlet, lightly disturbing the little cove where we'd been anchored. The marina charges about 1.92 per ft, there is no power or water here, but there's a pub ashore, a small cafe and many trails.</p>
