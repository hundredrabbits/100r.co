<aside class='notice'>At the moment we cannot ship stickers to US addresses due to the <a href="https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/cpc/en/support/campaign/shipping-to-us-duty-updates.page" target="_blank">suspension of the de minimis exemption</a>. We hope to resume shipments as soon as we can figure out how to comply with the new shipping rules. We apologize for this, hopefully, temporary suspension. Stay tuned for updates.</aside>
